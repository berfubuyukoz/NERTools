symbolises O
the O
diseases O
that O
affect O
medical O
education O
in O
this O
country O
today O
. O

though O
karnataka O
is O
a O
hot O
destination O
for O
students O
around O
the O
country O
who O
want O
to O
join O
the O
medical O
profession O
, O
the O
mushrooming O
of O
medical O
institutes O
in O
the O

, O
some O
of O
which O
do O
not O
have O
the O
necessary O
infrastructure O
for O

, O

some O
2,600 O

many O
of O
these O

though O
a O

earned O
a O
good O

some O
of O
them O
do O
not O

medical O
students O
of O

complain O
that O
they O

enough O
to O
prepare O
themselves O
for O
the O
profession O
. O

but O
one O
of O
the O
biggest O
complaints O
of O
students O
across O
all O
colleges O
and O
institutes O
is O
that O
the O
number O
of O
years O
of O
hard O
work O
they O
put O
in O
is O
not O
compensated O
adequately O
when O
they O
finish O
college O
. O

for O
an O

, O
students O
have O
to O
study O
for O
four O

half O
years O
and O
then O
do O

for O
a O
year O
. O

for O

, O
they O
have O
to O

in O
other O
parts O
of O
the O
country O
, O
there O
is O
no O
residency O
scheme O
in O
karnataka O
. O

the O
recent O

put O
primary O
focus O
on O
this O
. O

said O
a O
student O
leader O
, O
who O
did O
not O
want O
to O
be O
named O
, O
" O
a O
government O
had O
long O
back O
expressed O
its O
willingness O
to O
implement O
a O
residency O
scheme O
. O

the O
rajiv O
gandhi O
university O
( O
under O
which O
most O
medical O
colleges O
come O
) O
and O
the O
medical O
council O
of O
india O
( O
mci O
) O
have O
also O
strongly O
recommended O
such O
a O
scheme O
. O

but O
the O
government O
feels O
it O
's O
going O
to O
put O
an O
extra O
burden O
on O
them O
. O
" O
the O
state O
government O
has O
henceforth O
set O
up O
a O
committee O
to O
look O
into O
this O
demand O
. O

senior O
professor O
b O
sadashivamurthy O
, O
bangalore O
medical O
college O
, O
who O
has O
been O
made O
the O
rajiv O
gandhi O
university O
convenor O
of O
the O
committee O
, O
said O
, O
" O
we O
conducted O
a O
workshop O
recently O
in O
which O
the O
health O
secretary O
, O
director O
of O
medical O
education O
, O
college O
principals O
, O
professors O
and O
junior O
doctors O
participated O
. O

the O
rajiv O
gandhi O
university O
will O
soon O
send O
its O
set O
of O
recommendations O
to O
the O
state O
government O
on O
ways O
to O
implement O
the O
residency O
scheme O
. O
" O
he O
said O
the O
committee O
will O
also O
take O
care O
to O
suggest O
measures O
which O
will O
put O
the O
least O
possible O
burden O
on O
the O
government O
. O
" O
a O
residency O
scheme O
will O
bring O
in O
uniformity O
in O
the O
training O
for O
junior O
doctors O
with O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
country O
. O

it O
will O
give O
them O
a O
sense O
of O
responsibility O
and O
will O
ensure O
that O
the O
selection O
process O
for O
pg O
courses O
is O
more O
transparent O
, O
" O
he O
added O
. O

but O
the O
committee O
has O
still O
not O
decided O
how O
much O
stipend O
residents O
will O
be O
entitled O
to O
. O

dr O
sadashivamurthy O
said O
it O
would O
be O
much O
less O
than O
what O
residents O
in O
central O
government O
hospitals O
get O
. O

once O
the O
residency O
scheme O
is O
put O
in O
place O
junior O
doctors O
will O
be O
able O
handle O
cases O
on O
their O
own O
and O
will O
be O
made O
responsible O
that O
those O
cases O
. O

but O
the O
state O
of O
affairs O
among O
private O
junior O
doctors O
is O
not O
likely O
to O
change O
. O

said O
a O
junior O
doctor O
in O
a O
private O
hospital O
, O
" O
government O
hospital O
junior O
doctors O
have O
a O
voice O
, O
we O
do O
n't O
. O

our O
biggest O
problem O
is O
stipend O
. O

it O
's O
a O
pittance O
after O
all O
the O
years O
that O
we O
have O
put O
in O
for O
studies O
. O

but O
we O
have O
no O
way O
to O
vent O
our O
grievances O
. O
" O
she O
said O
the O
problem O
is O
not O
so O
acute O
in O
big O
private O
hospitals O
because O
at O
least O
they O
get O
enough O
work O
. O

but O
in O
smaller O
hospitals O
junior O
doctors O
do O
not O
get O
paid O
, O
they O
have O
to O
sign O
bonds O
for O
continued O
service O
and O
do O
not O
even O
get O
much O
work O
. O

junior O
doctors O
have O
also O
been O
protesting O
against O
rural O
service O
but O
the O
government O
feels O
they O
must O
be O
prepared O
for O
just O
a O
couple O
of O
years O
' O
service O
. O
" O
the O
government O
has O
made O
their O
education O
highly O
subsidised O
and O
the O
least O
they O
can O
do O
is O
put O
in O
two O
years O
of O
rural O
service O
before O
they O
their O
post O
graduation O
. O

those O
who O
do O
this O
service O
get O
preference O
for O
pg O
selection O
. O

often O
they O
say O
they O
'll O
do O
it O
after O
pg O
and O
then O
they O
are O
either O
off O
to O
the O
us O
or O
say O
they O
are O
too O
highly O
qualified O
for O
rural O
service O
, O
" O
said O
dr O
sadashivamurthy O
. O

a O
student O
in O
a O
private O
college O
complained O
that O
some O
smaller O
institutes O
actually O
hire O
faculty O
from O
andhra O
pradesh O
for O
a O
day O
or O
hire O
patients O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
nights O
to O
show O
that O
they O
have O
a O
good O
strength O
. O

the O
mci O
has O
formulated O
guidelines O
for O
the O
student-teacher O
ratio O
and O
the O
patient O
intake-student O
ration O
in O
a O
teaching O
hospital O
. O

it O
has O
also O
put O
a O
ceiling O
of O
150 O
students O
a O
year O
for O
medical O
colleges O
in O
the O
country O
. O
" O
to O
hoodwink O
the O
authorities O
, O
smaller O
private O
institutes O
resort O
to O
these O
unscrupulous O
methods O
so O
that O
they O
can O
increase O
their O
student O
intake O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

the O
only O
way O
to O
stop O
such O
practices O
is O
by O
the O
authorities O
to O
make O
their O
inspections O
" O
real O
surprise O
visits O
" O
and O
not O
they O
are O
conducted O
now O
and O
also O
take O
stern O
, O
exemplary O
action O
against O
erring O
institutes O
. O

a O
big O
problem O
for O
medical O
students O
in O
the O
country O
today O
is O
to O
get O
into O
a O
post O
graduate O
course O
. O
" O
in O
certain O
streams O
like O
surgery O
and O
cardiology O
, O
the O
demand O
is O
even O
greater O
than O
other O
streams O
like O
gynaecology O
or O
anaesthetics O
. O

even O
if O
you O
have O
done O
exceptionally O
well O
, O
there O
is O
no O
guarantee O
that O
you O
will O
get O
into O
the O
course O
you O
want O
. O

moreover O
, O
pg O
is O
very O
expensive O
. O

but O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
specialise O
, O
there O
is O
no O
place O
for O
you O
today O
, O
" O
a O
student O
complained O
. O

senior O
doctors O
sympathise O
with O
student O
doctors O
. O

they O
say O
unless O
facilities O
for O
students O
and O
junior O
doctors O
are O
improved O
in O
the O
country O
, O
the O
brain O
drain O
to O
the O
west O
will O
continue O
unabated O
. O

they O
say O
providing O
these O
facilities O
to O
student O
doctors O
may O
mean O
extra O
burden O
on O
the O
government O
but O
it O
will O
only O
go O
to O
help O
the O
country O
in O
the O
long O
run O
. O

a O
better-trained O

Ahmedabad place_pub
: O
has O
the O
congress O
in O
gujarat O
all O
but O
withered O
away O
? O

if O
you O
are O
surprised O
to O
hear O
the O
question O
, O
consider O
the O
following O
facts O
. O

early O
this O
week O
came O
the O
curious O
revelation O
that O
the O
son O
of O
the O
state O
's O
forest O
minister O
had O
been O
booked O
by O
none O
other O
than O
the O
forest O
department O
for O
his O
alleged O
hand O
in O
illegal O
felling O
and O
transportation O
of O
forest O
produce O
. O

both O
the O
father O
and O
the O
son O
have O
, O
of O
course O
, O
denied O
the O
charges O
and O
claimed O
the O
latter O
has O
been O
framed O
. O

it O
is O
quite O
possible O
that O
the O
son O
may O
be O
innocent O
, O
but O
the O
matter O
is O
still O
under O
examination O
. O

in O
the O
meanwhile O
you O
would O
have O
expected O
the O
major O
opposition O
party O
to O
create O
a O
furore O
. O

after O
all O
, O
matters O
like O
this O
do O
not O
surface O
every O
other O
day O
. O

but O
all O
we O
have O
heard O
was O
a O
whimper O
from O
state O
congress O
president O
amarsinh O
chaudhary O
. O

he O
said O
somewhere O
that O
the O
forest O
minister O
must O
go O
. O

nothing O
more O
. O

of O
course O
, O
chaudhary O
cannot O
be O
expected O
to O
raise O
a O
hue O
and O
cry O
on O
this O
matter O
; O
he O
was O
himself O
alleged O
to O
have O
been O
involved O
in O
a O
similar O
case O
a O
few O
years O
ago O
. O

but O
what O
about O
other O
state O
congress O
leaders O
? O

in O
the O
week O
following O
the O
unveiling O
of O
the O
tehelka O
tapes O
, O
a O
senior O
bjp O
mp O
told O
this O
correspondent O
rather O
contemptuously O
: O
" O
these O
congress O
chaps O
are O
absolutely O
useless O
. O

if O
we O
were O
in O
their O
place O
you O
would O
have O
seen O
the O
way O
we O
unleashed O
our O
campaign O
. O
" O
he O
was O
talking O
of O
congressmen O
in O
gujarat O
who O
were O
making O
an O
apology O
of O
an O
attempt O
to O
embarrass O
the O
government O
. O

the O
same O
was O
the O
case O
when O
the O
madhavpura O
scam O
broke O
out O
. O

but O
try O
telling O
congress O
leaders O
of O
the O
state O
that O
they O
look O
like O
a O
passenger O
train O
destined O
for O
nowhere O
, O
and O
you O
will O
probably O
provoke O
violent etype
reactions etype
similar O
to O
what O
principals type
of O
Ahmedabad place
colleges O
got O
from O
Nsui organizer_name
activists type
on etime
thursday etime
. O

for O
the O
record O
, O
the O
Nsui organizer_name
is O
student type
wing type
of O
the O
congress ideology
. O

ever O
since O
the O
congress O
captured O
power O
in O
the O
panchayat O
elections O
last O
year O
, O
party O
leaders O
have O
been O
on O
cloud O
nine O
. O

it O
is O
a O
foregone O
conclusion O
that O
we O
will O
come O
to O
power O
with O
a O
thumping O
majority O
in O
the O
next O
assembly O
election O
, O
is O
what O
congress O
men O
have O
been O
asserting O
since O
then O
. O

the O
keshubhai O
government O
is O
so O
corrupt O
and O
everybody O
is O
so O
fed O
up O
with O
them O
that O
nobody O
will O
vote O
for O
the O
bjp O
, O
they O
aver O
. O

but O
is O
this O
something O
that O
is O
so O
certain O
? O

performance-wise O
keshubhai O
has O
little O
to O
write O
home O
about O
. O

neither O
is O
the O
government O
expected O
to O
qualitatively O
improve O
its O
performance O
over O
the O
remaining O
period O
of O
its O
life O
. O

but O
elections O
are O
not O
fought O
on O
performance O
alone O
. O

if O
your O
competitor O
looks O
worse O
than O
you O
, O
then O
chances O
are O
that O
you O
might O
be O
voted O
back O
, O
whatever O
be O
your O
performance O
. O

ask O
the O
left O
front O
in O
calcutta O
and O
they O
might O
reveal O
how O
replacing O
jyoti O
basu O
with O
buddhadeb O
bhattacharya O
a O
few O
months O
before O
the O
election O
gave O
the O
lf O
a O
brand O
new O
image O
, O
one O
which O
shone O
compared O
with O
the O
rabble-rousing O
mamata O
banerjee O
. O

the O
congress O
could O
well O
be O
hurt O
the O
most O
by O
party O
worthy O
shankersinh O
vaghela O
. O

a O
former O
rss O
man O
, O
the O
highly-ambitious O
vaghela O
has O
never O
had O
full O
acceptability O
in O
the O
congress O
. O

and O
if O
the O
grapevine O
is O
to O
be O
believed O
, O
he O
is O
feeling O
restive O
ever O
since O
amarsinh O
was O
anointed O
the O

. O

there O
is O
nothing O
more O
that O
vaghela O
the O

can O
expect O
from O

it O
is O
possible O
that O
he O
might O
leave O

up O

reopened O
on O
thursday O
with O

their O
fortnight-long O

achieved O
nothing O

the O
teachers O
did O
n't O
really O
return O
to O

as O
victors O

some O
of O
them O
had O
that O
sheepish O

thursday O
was O
just O

but O
post-stir O

the O

indeed O

see O
their O

putting etype

it O
is O
still O

whether O
the O
students O
, O
who O
have O
already O
lost O
precious O
two O
weeks O
because O

this O
again O

not O

too O
popular O

there O
was O
an O
ominous O
silence O
as O
you O
enter O

where O
is O
the O

have O
indeed O
withdrawn O
their O

, O
you O
wonder O
. O

a O
peep O
into O
the O
classrooms O
proves O
that O
normal O
business O
is O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
back O
on O
track O

stern-looking O

are O

the O
