Well O

we O

We O
'll O
have O
a O

come O
out O

so O
I O
'll O
withhold O
my O
comments O
until O

Even O
as O
the O
secretary O

homeland B-ORG
security I-ORG
was O
putting O
his O
people O

alert O
last O

a O

utterly O
undetected O

, O
why O
has O
our O

placed O
homeland O
security O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
Republican B-ORG
political O
hacks O
instead O
of O

by O
the O
way O
? O

Attorney O
General O
John O

, O
for O
example O
, O
is O
a O

He O
lost O
an O

Secretary O

Tom O

Apparently O

Mr. O

it's O
really O
important O

like O

NOVAK O
Paul O
, O
as O
I O
understand O
your O
definition O
of O
a O
political O
-- O
of O
a O
professional O
politician O
based O
on O
that O
is O
somebody O
who O
is O
elected O
to O
public O
office O
. O

Now O
in O
your O
administration O
, O
the O
Clinton O
administration O
, O
there O
were O
these O
members O
of O
the O
cabinet O
who O
by O
your O
definition O
were O
professional O
politicians O
-- O
Lloyd O

one O

BEGALA O
And O
you O

they O
did O

And O
these O

Our O

NOVAK O

it O

OK O

it O

OK O
to O
have O
professional O

the O
Justice B-ORG

the O

... O
BEGALA O
Janet O

NOVAK O
Just O
a O
minute O

let O
me O
finish O

It O
's O
OK O
to O
put O
Democratic B-ORG
career O
politicians O
at O
the O

if O
they O

not O
if O

, O
is O
that O
right O

BEGALA O
No O

the O
difference O
is O
Janet O

was O
a O

( O
CROSSTALK O

BEGALA O
John O

half O

NOVAK O
Another O
potential O
Democratic B-ORG
presidential O
candidate O
pondered O
whether O
to O
run O
, O
and O
he O
made O
his O
announcement O
, O
and O
surprise O
, O
surprise O
, O
the O
answer O
was O
no O
. O

Senator O
Christopher O
Dodd O
of O
Connecticut B-LOC
made O
the O
announcement O
today O
that O
he O
would O
not O
be O
the O
10th O
candidate O
for O
the O
nomination O
. O

Why O
not O
? O

Surely O
Chris O
Dodd O
is O
at O
least O
more O
credible O
than O
Carol O
Moseley-Braun O
or O
Dennis O
Kucinich O
. O

He O
explained O
he O
could O
better O
spend O
the O
next O
two O
years O
on O
homeland O
security O
, O
the O
economy O
and O
judicial O
nominations O
. O

I O
guess O
that O
means O
harassing O
Tom O
Ridge O
, O
fighting O
tax O
cuts O
and O
obstructing O
President O
Bush O
's O
plans O
to O
reform O
judiciary O

Some O
two O

BEGALA O
God O

I O
hope O
so O

that O
's O
all O
I O
can O
say O

I O
love O
Senator O
Dodd O

He O
would O
have O

a O

He O
brings O
a O

to O
the O
Senate B-ORG

to O
the O

And O
I O
'm O
glad O
that O
he O
's O
going O
to O
be O
fighting O
those O
fights O

Well O
, O
the O
Commerce B-ORG
Department I-ORG
reports O
today O
that O
consumer O
spending O
declined O
in O
January O
and O
that O
the O
manufacturing O
sector O
slowed O
in O
February O
. O

In O
all O
, O
two O
million O
Americans O
have O
lost O
their O
jobs O
under O
President O
Bush O
so O
far O
, O
not O
to O
mention O
three O
of O
them O
being O
the O
top O
three O
leaders O
of O
his O
economic O
team O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
the O
deficit O
now O
at O
$ O
300 O
billion O

It O
could O
swell O
to O
as O
much O
as O
$ O
500 O
billion O
if O
we O
go O
to O
war O
in O
Iraq B-LOC

Mr. O
Bush O
apparently O
is O
untroubled O
by O
this O
fiscal O
collapse O

One O

Mr. O

we O

Republican O

California B-LOC

BEGALA O
Bob O
, O
one O
of O
the O
reasons O
I O
think O
so O
many O
Americans O
are O
worried O
about O
this O
war O
and O
so O
many O
people O
around O
the O
world O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
go O
is O
there O
have O
been O
a O
lot O
of O
problems O
with O
credibility O
from O
this O
administration O
. O

Our O
president O
has O
repeatedly O
, O
for O
example O
, O
relied O
on O
a O
man O
whom O
you O
're O
aware O
, O
Hussein O
Kamel O
, O
Saddam O
Hussein O
's O
son-in-law O
, O
leader O
of O
the O
Iraq B-LOC
arms O
program O
who O
defected O
for O
a O
time O
. O

And O
gave O
us O
a O
whole O
lot O
of O
information O
and O
then O
went O
home O
and O
his O
father-in-law O
killed O
him O
. O

Bad O
move O
. O

But O
while O
he O
was O
here O
, O
he O
gave O
us O
a O
whole O
lot O
of O
information O
. O

Gave O
us O
a O
whole O
lot O
of O
information O
. O

Well O
, O
our O
president O
told O
us O
that O
information O
proves O
that O
the O
dictator O
had O
chemical O
weapons O
, O
which O
is O
true O
. O

But O
what O
we O
just O
learned O
this O
week O
from O
`` O
Newsweek B-ORG
'' O
magazine B-ORG
which O
got O
a O
hold O
of O
the O
debriefings O
, O
is O
that O
he O
also O
told O
us O
it O
was O
destroyed O
back O
in O
1995 O
. O

Why O
has O
n't O
our O
president O
told O
us O
that O
? O

Why O
do O
we O
have O
to O
learn O
it O
from O
'' O
Newsweek B-ORG
'' O
? O

DORNAN O
I O
do O
n't O
believe O
that O
he O
believed O
it O
was O
all O
destroyed O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
this O
guy O
was O
such O
an O
idiot O
to O
go O
back O
and O
let O
his O
father-in-law O
kill O
him O
shows O
he O
was O
n't O
the O
most O
stable O
of O
people O
. O

But O
the O
things O
that O
... O
BEGALA O
Good O
point O
. O

But O
should O
n't O
our O
president O
have O
told O
us O
what O
the O
CIA B-ORG
told O
him O
. O

Why O
do O
we O
learn O
from O
`` O
Newsweek B-ORG
? O

`` O
Should O
he O
level O
with O
us O
? O

DORNAN O
Paul O
, O
look O
, O
the O
problem O
is O
I O
would O
stipulate O
all O
four O
of O
us O
hates O
war O
. O

Any O
rational O
person O
hates O
war O
. O

Bush O
is O
n't O
sitting O
in O
that O
White O
House O
not O
thinking O
about O
the O
body O
bags O
coming O
home O
with O
great O
young O
men O
. O

Clinton O
suffered O
greatly O
over O
the O
19 O
Rangers O
that O
died O
, O
18 O
on O
the O
3rd O
of O
October O

Matt O
Reersen O
( O

three O

I O
visited O
all O
their O
families O

I O
was O
at O
the O

ceremony O
for O
the O

. O

Let O
me O
tell O
you O
, O
what O
trips O
to O
Walter O
Reed O
taught O
me O
was O
, O
that O
whoever O
thought O
up O
the O
term O
, O
the O
law O
of O
unintended O
consequences O
it O
pertains O
to O
war O
. O

I O
am O
shook O
over O
the O
aftermath O

But O
, O
this O
guy O
is O
a O
monster O
, O
a O
mini-me O
Hitler O
. O

He O
will O
blow O
a O
city O
off O
the O
earth O
in O
a O
minute O
if O
he O
can O
get O
the O
hold O
of O
the O
means O
to O
do O
it O
. O

NOVAK O
Tom O
Andrews O
, O
I O
think O
we O
all O
realize O
that O
a O
government O
does O
n't O
go O
to O
war O
a O
nation O
goes O
to O
war O
. O

And O
so O
I O
would O
like O
you O
to O
take O
a O
look O
at O
the O
CNN/ B-ORG
'' O
USA B-ORG
TODAY I-ORG
'' O
/Gallup B-ORG
poll O
, O
taken O
last O

, O
should O
U.S B-LOC

remove O
Saddam O

from O

Take O
a O
look O
at O
it O
. O

Favor O
59 O
% O
, O
opposed O
37 O
% O
, O
that O

a O
vastly O
larger O

had O
in O

the O
U.S B-LOC

this O

I O
mean O
, O
listen O

this O
is O
the O
oldest O
trick O
in O
the O

You O
can O
have O
a O
general O
question O
like O
this O
that O
could O
mean O
anything O
and O
ask O
people O
and O
they O
give O
you O
what O
comes O
off O
the O
top O
of O
their O
head O
. O

But O
, O
ask O
them O
another O
question O
, O
ask O
them O
what O
they O
think O
about O
spending O
$ O
1.3 O
trillion O
in O
destroying O
this O
economy O
. O

Ask O
them O
about O
going O
and O
not O
just O
a O
war O
, O
Bob O
, O
but O
an O
invasion O
and O
occupying O
for O
up O
to O
10 O
years O
a O
sovereign O
Arab O
nation O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
one O
of O
the O
most O
distable O
and O
volatile O
regions O
in O
the O
world O
. O

Ask O
them O
how O
they O
feel O
about O
getting O
bogged O
down O
. O

Well O
, O
I O
've O
seen O
some O
of O
the O
figures O
. O

Once O
you O
start O
telling O
Americans O
the O
story O
, O
-- O
the O

refuse O
today O
tell O
us O
story O
. O

They O
're O
not O
coming O
forward O
and O
telling O
us O
what O
the O
risks O
are O
, O
what O
the O
costs O
are O
, O
how O
many O
years O
we O
might O
be O
in O
, O
the O
possibility O
of O
us O
getting O
bogged O
down O
, O
because O
what O
Americans O
know O
that O
, O
they O
're O
opposed O
to O
this O
war O
. O

The O
more O
they O
learn O
about O
this O

the O
more O
they O

about O
this O

Another O
one O
of O
your O

This O
is O
a O
medical O

Over O
80,000 O
Americans O

220 O
every O
day O
die O
from O
medical O
negligence O
, O
hundred O
of O
thousands O
are O
injured O

And O
the O
insurance O
companies O
which O
had O
relatively O
steady O
rates O
on O
doctors O
for O
about O
10 O
years O
have O
found O
its O
investment O

its O

the O

collapse O
down O

And O
so O
they O

jacking O
up O
the O

a O
few O
key O

that O

paid O
by O

they O
'd O
be O
paying O
less O

That O
's O
one-third O
of O

as O

PALMISANO O
Well O

the O

medical O
liability O
system O

they O
ca O
n't O
get O
access O

The O
American B-ORG
Medical O
Association B-ORG
works O
very O
hard O
to O
make O
safety O
a O
priority O
in O
the O
medical O
care O
system O
. O

That's O
why O
we O
founded O
the O
National B-ORG
Patient O
Safety O
Foundation B-ORG
. O

The O
current O
system O
does O
n't O
measure O
negligence O
. O

It O
measures O
disability O
. O

And O
what O
we're O
finding O
now O
is O
that O
the O
emergency O
rooms O
are O
closing O

trauma O

are O
closing O

pregnant O
women O
ca O
n't O

happened O

there O
were O
no O

neurosurgeons O

The O
patient O
had O

you O

Mr. O

point O

Who O
are O
you O

who O
's O
our O

to O
tell O
him O
that O
his O

is O
only O
worth O
$ O
250,000 O
for O
the O
loss O
of O
a O
child O
? O

PALMISANO O
Well O
, O
what O
has O
to O
be O
done O
here O
is O
balance O
. O

What O
we O
need O
is O
a O
system O
that O
's O
fair O
to O
everyone O
, O
a O
system O
that O
keeps O
the O
physicians O
in O
practice O
and O
allows O
patients O
to O
have O
access O
to O
physicians O
in O
their O
hour O
of O
need O

And O
the O
system O
in O
California B-LOC
that O
's O
in O
the O
bill O
, O
in O
Congress B-ORG
now O
, O
HR-5 O
, O
that O
's O
a O
system O
that O
has O
worked O
. O

It O
brought O
stability O
to O
California B-LOC

obstetricians O

will O

, O
they O
'll O
pay O
$ O
210,000 O

( O

they O

been O
very O

And O
in O
some O

there O
are O

and O
they O
're O

NOVAK O
Welcome O

Both O
the O
AMA B-ORG

the O
Bush O

released O
reports O
this O

saying O
out O
of O
control O
trial O
lawyers O
are O
driving O
doctors O
out O
of O
their O

all O
across O
the O

President O
Bush O
points O
this O
way O
today O
, O
even O
the O
most O
frivolous O
of O
lawsuits O
cost O
money O
, O

go O
up O

either O

We O

Dr. O

thanks O
for O
staying O

through O

Let O
me O
set O
aside O
the O
hypocrisy O
of O
a O
man O
who O
became O
president O
because O
of O
a O
lawsuit O
trying O
to O
eliminate O
everybody O
else O
's O
lawsuits O
, O
but O
instead O
focus O
on O
his O
own O
experience O
. O

He O
was O
the O
governor O
of O
my O
state O
of O
Texas B-LOC
, O
where O
there O
are O
a O
whole O
lot O
of O
doctors O
. O

It O
turns O
out O
that O
he O
did O
n't O
do O
any O
kind O
of O
a O
job O
policing O
your O
profession O
at O
all O
when O
he O
was O
the O
governor O
of O
Texas B-LOC

Here O
's O
what O
the O
`` O
Dallas B-ORG

reported O
recently O

the O

thrown O
out O

they O
botched O

maimed O

the O

of O
a O

That O

why O

What O
we O

do O
is O
to O
make O

that O

have O
adequate O

The O
AMA B-ORG

that O

If O
there O
are O
any O

we O
want O

removed O

it O

also O
unfair O
to O
make O
a O
judgment O
without O
knowing O
all O
of O
the O

the O

Because O
someone O
pays O

in O
a O

the O

may O
pay O

because O
they O
're O

BEGALA O
Congressman O
Hayworth O
, O
back O
to O
a O
comment O
. O

And O
I O
know O
that O
you O
meant O
it O
and O
I O
agreed O
with O
it O
. O

You O
said O
, O
`` O
This O
is O
Saddam O
Hussein O
, O
the O
butcher O
of O
Baghdad B-LOC
. O
'' O

I O
'm O
curious O
, O
would O
that O
have O
accurately O
described O
him O
in O
1988 O
? O

HAYWORTH O
Oh O
, O
yes O
. O

I O
think O
it O
does O
. O

I O
think O
it O
has O
described O
him O
, O
especially O
since O
he O
's O
taken O
basically O
a O
one-man O
rule O
over O
with O
the O
Baath B-ORG
Party I-ORG
in O
1979 O
. O

BEGALA O
I O
agree O
. O

Therefore O
, O
was O
n't O
Dick O
Cheney O
, O
as O
the O
CEO O
of O
Halliburton B-ORG
, O
wrong O
to O
be O
selling O
oilfield O
equipment O
to O
the O
butcher O
of O
Baghdad B-LOC
in O
1988 O
? O

HAYWORTH O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
about O
any O
oil O
equipment O
going O
to O
Saddam O
Hussein O
. O

What O
I O
do O
know O
in O
the O
here O
and O
now O
is O
... O
BEGALA O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
about O
it O
if O
you O
like O
. O

HAYWORTH O
That O
's O
fine O
. O

And O
I O
know O
you O
'd O
love O
to O
cloud O
the O
issue O
. O

BEGALA O
That O
's O
an O
important O
issue O
to O
me O

HAYWORTH O
No O
, O
it O
's O
so O
important O
-- O
you O
know O
this O
-- O
and O
I O
know O
it O
's O
fun O
and O
we O
love O
doing O
partisan O
Punch O
& O
Judy O
, O
but O
is O
there O
ever O
a O
time O
when O
we O
stand O
up O
even O
if O
we O
respectfully O
disagree O
with O
the O
commander O
in O
chief O
and O
those O
who O
would O
wage O
war O
? O

Dissent O
is O
fine O
, O
but O
these O
cheap O
shots O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
anything O
about O
Halliburton B-ORG

BEGALA O
He O
had O

73 O
million O
worth O
of O

to O
sell O
oilfield O

to O
Saddam O

( O

HAYWORTH O
What O
I O
do O
know O
is O
Saddam O
Hussein O
has O
butchered O
over O
a O
million O
of O
his O
own O
citizens O
. O

And O
to O
somehow O
try O
to O
play O
partisan O
parlor O
games O
may O
be O
cute O
, O
but O
we O
are O
dealing O
with O
a O
clear O
and O
present O
danger O
. O

BEGALA O
Would O
you O
have O
treated O
him O
as O
a O
customer O
, O
the O
way O
Dick O
Cheney O
did O
? O

HAYWORTH O
I O
do O
n't O
even O
know O
about O
that O

BEGALA O
Would O
you O
have O
sold O

the O

SANDERS O
What O
we O

talking O
about O
is O
the O

what O
could O
happen O
in O
this O
war O
. O

For O
example O
-- O
wait O
a O
second O
-- O
in O
Iran B-LOC
, O
the O
reason O
that O
you O
had O
Ayatollah O
Khomeini O
in O

is O
he O
overthrew O
the O

You O

HAYWORTH O
Oh O
the O

SANDERS O
But O
the O
point O
is O
... O
NOVAK O
I O
want O
to O
get O
to O
that O
point O
. O

But O
the O
problem O
with O
Khomeini O
was O
that O
the O
guy O
who O
he O
overthrew O
was O
put O
in O
power O
by O
the O
United B-LOC

I O
ca O
n't O
quite O
figure O
that O
out O

SANDERS O
We O
overthrew O
( O
UNINTELLIGIBLE O

and O
put O
the O
Shah O
of O
Iran B-LOC

power O
. O

Everybody O
knows O
that O
. O

The O
CIA B-ORG
did O
that O

NOVAK O
But O
I O
mean O
you O
're O
attacking O
the O
CIA B-ORG
for O
putting O
him O
in O
, O
when O
it O
was O
-- O
the O
problem O
was O
Khomeini O
. O

SANDERS O
No O
, O
the O
point O
I O
made O
, O
Khomeini O
came O
about O
because O
we O
put O
a O
brutal O
dictator O
, O
the O
Shah O
of O
Iran B-LOC
, O
in O
power O
. O

The O
point O
that O
I O
am O
making O
is O
you O
can O
not O
... O
HAYWORTH O
The O
point O
you O
're O
making O
is O
blame O
America B-LOC
first O
. O

SANDERS O
No O
I O
'm O
not O
. O

HAYWORTH O
That O
's O
what O
you O
're O
doing O

SANDERS O
You O
're O
talking O
about O

You O

Hi O

I O

Christa O
Demore O
( O

from O
Monrovia B-LOC
, O
Maryland B-LOC

And O
I O
'm O
curious O
, O
how O
can O
Democrats O
claim O
that O
President O
Bush O
is O
ignoring O
the O
war O
on O
terror O
if O
al B-ORG

second O
key O

was O
just O
caught O

And O
it O
also O

you O
can O
even O

Does O

So O
I O
'm O
still O
doubtful O
of O
-- O
no O
, O
here O
's O
why O
. O

This O
is O
a O
serious O
point O
and O
you O
deserve O
a O
serious O
answer O
. O

The O
way O
we O
caught O
that O
guy O
was O
by O
coordinating O
with O
our O
allies O
. O

We O
now O
have O
a O
foreign O
policy O
in O
Iraq B-LOC
that O
is O
putting O
enormous O
strain O
on O
those O
allies O

No O

it O

Why O
do O

NOVAK O
Well O

where O
are O
all O
of O
the O

questions O

We O
never O

There O
's O
no O
question O

I O
think O
even O

agree O
with O
me O
. O

The O
question O
of O
whether O
we O
go O

or O
not O
is O
strictly O
a O
national O
question O
. O

It O
's O
not O
a O
United B-ORG

question O

BEGALA O
That O
is O
correct O
. O

The O
president O
has O
got O
all O
of O
the O
legal O
authorities O
he O
needs O
. O

I O
just O
pray O
to O
god O
he O
does O
n't O
use O
it O
. O

We O
need O
to O
go O
to O
the O
U.N B-ORG

because O
we O
want O
to O
build O
coalitions O
so O
we O
have O
support O

the O

and O
so O
that O
we O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
carry O
the O

On O

Wednesday O

the O

you O

our O
own O
little O
moonwalk O
across O

the O
`` O

The O
foreign O
ministers O
of O
France B-LOC

Germany B-LOC
and O

today O
issued O
a O
joint O
declaration O
that O

not O
allow O
a O
second O
American-backed B-LOC
resolution O
to O
pass O
the O
United B-ORG
Nations I-ORG
Security O
Council O
. O

President O
Bush O
wants O
the O
Security O
Council O
to O
explicitly O
authorize O
force O
against O
Iraq B-LOC

and O
his O
press O
secretary O
today O
remained O
optimistic O
that O
in O
the O
end O
, O
that O
's O
just O
what O
he O
'll O
get O

President O
Bush O
is O
said O
to O
be O
focusing O
on O
one O
fence-sitting O
Security O
Council O
member O
, O
the O
African B-LOC

because O
he O
said O

`` O
I O
used O

So O
-- O
OK O

I O
made O
that O
up O

He O
did O

that O

TUCKER O
CARLSON O

Well O
, O
I O
suspected O
that O
. O

You O
know O
... O
BEGALA O
But O
they O
are O
a O
swing O
vote O
. O

Guinea B-LOC
is O
an O
important O
swing O
vote O
. O

CARLSON O
As O
is O
Cameroon B-LOC

France B-LOC
and O
Germany B-LOC
are O
pointing O
to O
inspection O
and O
saying O
, O
Look O
, O
they O
're O
working O
. O

We O
do O
n't O
need O
war O
. O

They O
're O
not O
pointing O
out O
that O
inspections O
are O
working O
only O
because O
there O
's O
the O
credible O
threat O
of O
war O
. O

Saddam O
would O
n't O
be O
destroying O
missiles O
unless O
he O
thought O
he O
was O
going O
to O
be O
destroyed O
if O
he O
did O
n't O
. O

BEGALA O
I O
think O
that O
's O
a O
good O
point O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
mean O
we O
have O
to O
go O
to O
war O
. O

But O
I O
think O
President O
Bush O
should O
get O
credit O
for O
pushing O
to O
instructions O
and O
backing O
them O
up O
with O
the O
threat O
of O
force O
. O

CARLSON O
It O
means O
when O
you O
take O
the O
threat O
of O
force O
of O
the O
table O
, O
you O
're O
likely O
to O
stop O
disarming O
Saddam O
Hussein O
. O

BEGALA O
Yes O
, O
I O
'm O
not O
saying O
take O
the O
threat O
of O
force O
. O

I O
'm O
saying O
we O
do O
n't O
need O
to O
use O
force O
right O
now O
. O

CARLSON O
Well O
, O
France B-LOC
and O
Germany B-LOC
would O
like O
to O
. O

Secretary O
of O
State O
Colin O
Powell O
today O
responded O
to O
Saddam O

latest O
attempts O
to O
fool O
the O

Powell O
called O
Iraqi B-LOC
steps O
toward O
disarmament O
-- O
quote O
-- O
`` O
too O
little O
, O
too O

'' O
gestures O
, O
meant O
to O
split O
international O
resolve O
to O
force O
Baghdad B-LOC
to O
give O
up O
its O
weapons O
of O
mass O
destruction O
. O

U.S B-LOC
. O

intelligence O
said O
Powell O
indicates O
Iraq B-LOC
has O
hidden O
equipment O
to O
produce O
al-Samoud O
2 O
missiles O
, O
even O
as O
it O
destroys O
existing O
ones O
, O
missiles O
that O
until O
recently O
, O
it O
claimed O
not O
to O
have O
. O

Powell O
also O
revealed O
that O
Iraq B-LOC
is O
hiding O
chemical O
and O
biological O
weapons O
in O
poor O
neighborhoods O
around O
Baghdad B-LOC
. O

In O
order O
to O
secure O
peace O
, O
Powell O
concluded O
, O
the O
international O
community O
must O
confront O
Saddam O
Hussein O
's O
refusal O
to O
disarm O
-- O
quote O
-- O
`` O
here O
and O
now O

'' O

So O
, O
there O
you O
have O
it O
. O

The O
essence O
of O
the O
American B-LOC
case O
for O
war O
against O
Saddam O
Hussein O
. O

The O
only O
question O
left O
: O
who O
do O
you O
believe O
? O

Secretary O
of O
State O
Colin O
Powell O
or O
France B-LOC
? O

BEGALA O
No O
, O
the O
question O
is O
... O
CARLSON O
That O
is O
the O
question O
. O

BEGALA O
Who O
do O
you O
believe O
: O
the O
Bush O
administration O
or O
your O
lying O
eyes O
? O

We O
are O
watching O
them O
destroy O
weapons O
, O
as O
the O
president O
says O
, O
Oh O
, O
that O
's O
just O
a O
hoax O
. O

CARLSON O
But O
Paul O
... O
BEGALA O
They O
are O
disarming O
. O

CARLSON O
No O
, O
no O
, O
no O
that O
's O
not O
what O
the O
president O
's O
saying O
. O

He O
's O
saying O
, O
the O
-- O
it O
's O
a O
hoax O
to O
the O
extent O
that O
those O
are O
only O
a O
small O
number O
of O
the O
weapons O
there O
. O

Keep O
in O
mind O
, O
these O
are O
weapons O
that O
Saddam O
Hussein O
, O
until O
recently O
, O
said O
he O
did O
n't O
even O
have O
. O

He O
's O
a O

BEGALA O
Of O

CARLSON O

BEGALA O
Well O
, O
those O
of O
you O
who O
still O
believe O
the O
myth O
of O
the O
liberal O
media O
should O
consider O
this O
: O
MSNBC B-ORG
, O
an O
obscure O
cable O
channel O
, O
has O
fired O
Phil O
Donahue O
, O
the O
host O
of O
its O
highest-rated O
show O
. O

A O
memo O
from O
inside O
NBC B-ORG
, O
reported O
on O
the O
Web O
site O
allyourtv.com O
, O
and O
today O
in O
`` O
The B-ORG
Washington O
Post B-ORG

'' O
shows O
NBC B-ORG
big O
wigs O
feared O
that O
the O
liberal O
Mr. O
Donahue O
represented O
in O
the O
words O
of O
the O
NBC B-ORG
memo O
-- O
quote O
-- O
`` O
a O
difficult O
public O
face O
for O
NBC B-ORG
at O
a O
time O
of O
war O
, O
while O
our O
competitors O
are O
waving O
the O
flag O
at O
every O
opportunity O
because O
he O
seems O
to O
delight O
in O
presenting O

who O
are O
anti-war O
, O
anti-Bush O
and O
skeptical O
of O
the O

'' O

So O
there O
it O
is O
, O
according O
to O
NBC B-ORG
. O

Phil O
Donahue O
was O
fired O
because O
he O
's O
a O
liberal O

In O

the O
only O
liberal O

of O

is O
a O

where O
they O
apparently O
only O
bring O

CARLSON O
I O
actually O
like O
Phil O
Donahue O
. O

I O
've O
interviewed O
him O
a O
number O
of O
times O

His O
arguments O
are O
really O
dumb O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
you O
've O
listened O
to O
Phil O
Donahue O

Delightful O
guy O
, O
but O
his O
arguments O
do O
n't O
make O
a O
lot O
of O
sense O
and O
I O
think O
that O
is O
the O
problem O
with O
liberal O
talk O
show O
hosts O
-- O
you O
excluded O
, O
of O
course O
, O
and O
James O

But O
the O
arguments O
, O
actually O
, O
do O
n't O
hold O
up O
very O
well O
. O

Have O
you O
noticed O
that O
? O

BEGALA O
You O
know O
, O
you O
can O
argue O
back O
and O
forth O
, O
but O
you O
should O
n't O
fire O
someone O
because O
of O
their O
political O
views O
and O
that O
's O
what O
NBC B-ORG
has O
done O
and O
shame O
on O
the O

OK O

I O

CARLSON O
Former O

BEGALA O
Mr. O
King O
, O
thanks O
for O
stying O
with O

through O
the O
break O

One O
of O
the O
reasons O
that O
we O
like O
having O
you O
on O
, O
and O
as O
well O
as O
Mr. O
Rangel O
, O
is O
that O
, O
you O
know O
, O
this O
is O
war O
, O
as O
we O
were O
saying O
in O
the O
last O
segment O
. O

You O
treat O
it O
with O
the O
gravity O
and O
the O
seriousness O
that O
it O
deserves O
. O

And O
you O
're O
a O
congressman O
who O
has O
put O
his O
constituents O
and O
his O
country O
ahead O
of O
his O
partisan O
interests O
. O

So O
I O
wonder O
if O
you O
'll O
join O
Charlie O
Rangel O
, O
who O
put O
out O
a O
press O
release O
today O
, O
decrying O
the O
Republican B-ORG
attempt O
to O
hijack O
a O
bill O
to O
help O
our O
servicemen O
to O
use O
it O
to O
give O
special O
interest O
tax O
breaks O
to O
corporations O
. O

Is O
n't O
that O
wrong O
in O
a O
time O
of O
war O
? O

KING O
The O
important O
thing O
is O
that O
the O
bill O
pass O
for O
the O
military O
. O

If O
the O
other O
stuff O
's O
in O
there O
, O
it O
's O
there O
. O

I O
mean O
to O
me O
, O
the O
main O
purpose O
should O
be O
the O
military O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
going O
to O
disagree O
with O
Charlie O
's O
point O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
often O
when O
bills O
are O
passed O
, O
there O
are O
things O
attached O
to O
them O
. O

So O
to O
me O
, O
the O
key O
thing O
is O
that O
we O
ought O
to O
be O
taking O
care O
of O
the O
military O
and O
that O
's O
what O
we O
should O
do O
. O

CARLSON O
Congressman O
Rangel O
, O
a O
couple O
of O
months O
ago O
Senator O
Daschle O
on O
CBS O
said O
-- O
made O
the O
charge O
that O
we O
are O
, O
quote O
, O
`` O
we O
have O
n't O

Rawalpindi B-LOC

Does O
n't O
it O
turn O
out O
that O
Mr. O
Daschle O
and O
others O
did O
n't O
know O
what O
they O
were O
talking O
about O
and O
maybe O
they O
should O
n't O
make O
charges O
like O
that O
in O
public O
when O
they O
do O
n't O

what O
they O

They O

Mr. O

used O
a O

They O
went O
through O

But O
they O
did O

Saddam O

his O

and O
they O
were O

They O

Dick O

have O
never O

I O

What O

BEGALA O
It O

Cheney O
is O

He O

trying O

CARLSON O
No O

no O

OK O

That O

it O

Chad O

'' O

I O
wonder O
why O
they O
protest O
the O

It O
must O
be O
the O
humanitarian O
reasons O
. O
'' O

Well O
, O
Chad O
, O
that O
's O
what O
liberals O
assume O
. O

That O
Europe B-LOC
is O
against O
the O
war O
on O
humanitarian O
and O
moral O
grounds O
, O
but O
the O
U.S B-LOC
. O

is O
for O
the O
war O
because O
it O
wants O
to O
profit O
for O
the O
oil O
companies O
. O

It O
is O
a O
weird O
assumption O
, O
do O
n't O
you O
think O
? O

BEGALA O
As O
you O
know O
, O
I O
've O
never O
said O
that O
. O

CARLSON O
You O
have O
n't O

BEGALA O
I O
do O
n't O
believe O
for O
a O
minute O
that O
this O
is O
a O
war O
for O

. O

I O
think O
it's O
unwise O
, O
it O
's O
unjust O
, O
it O
's O
unwarranted O
, O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
's O
about O
oil O
. O

Now O
, O
the O
reason O
that O
France B-LOC
, O
Russia B-LOC
and O
Germany B-LOC
are O
against O
war O
is O
because O
they O
have O
democracies O
. O

The O
people O
are O
against O
it O

It O

Those O

are O

I O
'm O
from O
Minneapolis B-LOC

Minnesota B-LOC

And O
I O
was O
just O
curious O
if O
you O
feel O
that O
the O
attack O
on O
Iraq B-LOC
would O
actually O
open O
a O
Pandora O

box O
in O
other O
Middle B-LOC

that O
we O
are O

to O

harbor O

such O
as O
Syria B-LOC

CARLSON O
It O
might O
. O

I O
mean O
that O
's O
absolutely O
one O
of O
the O
fears O

That O
it O
would O
destabilize O
the O

On O
the O

the O

filled O
with O

who O
already O
hate O
Americans O

to O
do O

So O
the O
question O
is O
, O
could O
it O
be O
worse O

BEGALA O
Our O

believes O
it O
will O
set O
off O

positive O

UNIDENTIFIED O
MALE O
Again O
, O
we O
know O
where O
we O
're O
going O

We O
know O
where O
they O
're O
at O
so O
we O
simply O
avoid O
them O
and O
if O
for O
some O
reason O
they O
do O
get O
off O
a O
lucky O
shot O
or O
they O
do O
see O
us O
, O
we O
have O
defensive O
systems O
on O
board O
the O
airplane O
to O
defeat O
their O
ammunition O
. O

TUCHMAN O
We O
all O
fly O
with O
bulletproof O
vests O
in O
case O
the O
plane O
goes O
down O
. O

We O
also O
fly O
with O
parachutes O
in O
case O
we O
need O
to O
get O
out O
before O
the O
plane O
goes O
down O
. O

( O
voice-over O
) O
: O
But O
three O
airmen O
aboard O
this O
plane O
have O
parachutes O
for O
a O
different O
reason O
. O

They O
are O
the O
Pararescue O

, O
or O
PJs O
who O
jump O
off O
the O

for O
rescue O
missions O

UNIDENTIFIED O

I O

it O

the O

the O
best O
feeling O

knowing O
that O
your O
purpose O
is O
really O
defined O
at O
that O
moment O

TUCHMAN O
No O

were O
necessary O
on O
this O

The O

arrived O
back O

safely O

( O

Do O
you O
have O
any O
fear O
? O

UNIDENTIFIED O
MALE O
Everybody O
has O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
fear O
but O
I O
think O
it O
's O
a O
good O
thing O
in O
this O
circumstance O
. O

TUCHMAN O
( O

This O

were O
surrendering O
. O

At O
the O
Pentagon B-ORG
briefing O
today O
, O
General O
Stanley O
McChrystal O
said O
that O
it O
looked O
a O
lot O
like O
terrorism O
. O

MCCHRYSTAL O
It O
looks O
and O
feels O
like O
terrorism O
and O
what O
it O
requires O
is O
units O
to O
conduct O
forced O
production O
activities O
which O
they O
are O
prepared O
and O
do O
all O
the O
time O
but O
clearly O
when O
you O
see O
a O
tactic O
like O
this O
, O
it O
requires O
strict O
adherence O
or O
adjustments O
to O
your O
tactics O
, O
techniques O
and O
procedures O
to O
ensure O
that O
places O
like O
checkpoints O
are O
not O
vulnerable O
. O

So O
it O
won't O
change O
our O
overall O
rules O
of O
engagement O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
effect O
the O
operation O
at O
large O
but O
to O
protect O
our O
soldiers O
it O
clearly O
requires O
great O
care O
. O

PLANTE O
So O
certainly O
an O
unpleasant O
development O
today O
Judy O
and O
another O
item O
on O
the O
docket O
over O
here O
today O
is O
the O
failure O
of O
a O
number O
of O
cruise O
missiles O
. O

Tomahawk O
land O
detect O
missiles O
being O
from O
launched O
from O
ships O
in O
the O
eastern O
Mediterranean O
and O
in O
the O
Red B-LOC
Sea I-LOC
have O
suffered O
a O
number O
of O
failures O
. O

The O
Pentagon B-ORG
says O
a O
total O
of O
seven O
of O
the O
cruise O
missiles O
have O
failed O
crashing O
in O
Turkey B-LOC
and O
in O
Saudi B-LOC
Arabia I-LOC
. O

No O
injuries O
reported O
. O

The O
missiles O
are O
programmed O
so O
that O
they O
do O
n't O
detonate O
until O
they O
reach O
their O
target O
. O

If O
they O
go O
astray O
, O
then O
the O
warheads O
never O
arm O
but O
claiming O
that O
it O
's O
about O
one O
percent O
of O
the O
warheads O
. O

They O
've O
fired O
675 O
or O
so O
tomahawk O
land O
detect O
missiles O
from O
ships O
and O
seven O
of O
those O
have O
failed O
. O

Judy O

WOODRUFF O
Chris O
, O
very O
quickly O
, O
new O
information O
from O
the O
Pentagon B-ORG
today O
about O
any O
concerns O
they O
have O
about O
Saddam O
Hussein O
's O
ongoing O
air O
defense O
capability O
? O

PLANTE O
Well O
, O
no O
major O
concern O
. O

The O
Pentagon B-ORG
says O
that O
they O
do O
have O
air O
dominance O
as O
they O
now O
call O
it O
over O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
the O
country O
that O
there O
are O
certain O
areas O
and O
only O
certain O
areas O
of O
downtown O
Iraq O
where O
battle O
management O
radars O
linked O
to O
surface O
to O
air O
missiles O
are O
still O
in O
tact O
. O

The O
reason O
that O
they O
're O
still O
in O
tact O
according O
to O
today O
's O
briefing O
was O
that O
they O
had O
not O
turned O
them O
on O
and O
as O
long O
as O
they O
do O
n't O
turn O
them O
on O
, O
the O
U.S B-LOC
. O

has O
trouble O
locating O
them O
. O

They O
assure O
us O
that O
as O
soon O
as O
they O
do O
start O
turning O
on O
these O
radars O
that O
they O
'll O
take O
those O
out O
too O
and O
finish O
the O
job O
in O
terms O
of O

That O

just O
a O
short O
time O
ago O
. O

Well O

CNN B-ORG

Ken O

the O

Policy B-ORG

the O
Brookings B-ORG

is O

He O
is O
an O
expert O
on O
the O
Iraqi B-LOC
military O
and O
its O
tactics O
and O
weapons O

Ken O
Pollack O
, O
that O
resistance O
that O
we O
just O
saw O
the O
British B-LOC
troops O
dealing O
with O
, O
you O
and O
I O
were O
talking O
earlier O
today O
. O

The O
story O
the O
last O
few O
days O
has O
been O
the O
surprising O
level O
of O
resistance O
but O
you O
're O
telling O
me O
your O
sense O
is O
that O
the O
coalition B-LOC
forces O
are O
beginning O
to O
adjust O
to O
that O
. O

KEN O
POLLACK O
, O
CENTER O
FOR O
MIDDLE O
EAST O
POLICY O
, O
BROOKINGS O
INSTITUTION O
Right O
. O

I O
mean O
we O
're O
seeing O
one O
of O
the O
great O
advantages O
of O
U.S B-LOC
. O

and O
British B-LOC
forces O
now O
, O
Judy O
, O
which O
is O
that O
they O
're O
superbly O
trained O
troops O
. O

They O
have O
training O
in O
a O
whole O
variety O
of O
different O
missions O
and O
they're O
adapting O
. O

They O
recognize O
now O
they O
went O
in O
with O
some O
false O
assumptions O
about O
the O
kind O
of O
reception O
that O
they O
were O
going O
to O
face O
. O

The O
plan O
that O
was O
implemented O
had O
some O
inherent O
risks O
in O
it O
, O
risks O
to O
the O
supply O
line O
, O
risks O
in O
terms O
of O
not O
clearing O
cities O
and O
they O
're O
shifting O
. O

They're O
changing O
and O
the O
troops O
are O
trained O
well O
enough O
to O
be O
able O
to O
deal O
with O
that O
. O

You O
've O
seen O
U.S B-LOC
. O

Central B-ORG
Command I-ORG
bringing O
up O
additional O
forces O
like O
the O
82nd B-ORG
Airborne O
Division B-ORG
to O
better O
deal O
with O
these O
long O
supply O
lines O
, O
get O
control O
over O
the O
cities O
and O
so O
I O
think O
that O
U.S B-LOC
. O

and O
British B-LOC
forces O
are O
beginning O
to O
stabilize O
the O
battlefield O
. O

WOODRUFF O
So O
as O
an O
onlooker O
, O
as O
somebody O
who O
's O
studied O
the O
Iraqi B-LOC
capabilities O
, O
is O
it O
your O
sense O
that O
the O
coalition O
can O
continue O
to O
adjust O
to O
whatever O
they O
deal O
with O
? O

POLLACK O
Absolutely O
. O

One O
of O
the O
things O
I O
think O
we O
're O
likely O
to O
see O
is O
that O
the O
Iraqis O
are O
going O
to O
have O
a O
tougher O
time O
adapting O
than O
U.S B-LOC
. O

forces O
are O
. O

Typically O
what O
you O
've O
seen O
in O
the O
Iraqi B-LOC
armed O
forces O
is O
the O
change O
has O
to O
come O
from O
the O
top O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
come O
from O
the O
ground O
up O
. O

You O
do O
n't O
have O
ground O
commanders O
calling O
back O
and O
saying O
hey O
, O
we O
'd O
like O
to O
try O
this O
tactic O
or O
this O
seems O
to O
work O
. O

Tell O
everybody O
else O
to O
do O
the O
same O
thing O
. O

Instead O
the O
high O
command O
has O
to O
identify O
a O
problem O
, O
come O
up O
with O
a O
solution O
and O
transmit O
it O
down O
. O

Chances O
are O
the O
Iraqis O
are O
going O
to O
continue O
to O
stick O
with O
what O
we O
've O
seen O
before O
, O
irregular O
forces O
blending O
in O
with O
civilians O
trying O
to O
attack O
U.S B-LOC
. O

forces O
, O
some O
more O
of O
these O
suicide O
attacks O
which O
are O
going O
to O
be O
problematic O
for O
our O
troops O
. O

There's O
no O
way O
around O
that O
but O
U.S B-LOC
. O

forces O
, O
British B-LOC
forces O
are O
beginning O
to O
adapt O
to O
it O
. O

WOODRUFF O
I O
want O
to O
ask O
you O
about O
you O
mentioned O
coalition O
forces O
going O
in O
expecting O
more O
support O
from O
ordinary O
Iraqi B-LOC
people O
. O

I O
just O
interviewed O
a O
gentleman O
, O
native O
of O
Iraq B-LOC
, O
who O
talks O
to O
his O
family O
there O
all O
the O
time O
and O
he O
says O
they O
live O
in O
Baghdad B-LOC
20 O
, O
30 O
, O
50 O
of O
them O
and O
he O
said O
they O
do O
the O
view O
the O
Americans O
as O
invaders O
. O

They O
hate O
Saddam O
Hussein O
. O

They O
do O
n't O
like O
what O
he O
's O
doing O
but O
they O
do O
n't O
think O
the O
Americans O
are O
the O
answer O
. O

POLLACK O
All O
right O
. O

Well O
, O
this O
is O
something O
that O
we O
've O
been O
trying O
to O
get O
a O
grip O
on O
for O
years O
, O
exactly O
what O
the O
Iraqi B-LOC
people O
feel O
and O
also O
that O
I O
think O
the O
best O
evidence O
that O
we O
had O
before O
the O
attack O
began O
was O
that O
Iraqis O
do O
, O
they O
despise O
. O

They O
are O
desperate O
to O
be O
rid O
of O
him O
but O
by O
the O
same O
token O
, O
they O
do O
n't O
like O
another O
country O
coming O
into O
their O
country O
to O
overturn O
the O
government O
and O
beyond O
that O
, O
I O
think O
it O
's O
probably O
most O
important O
for O
most O
Iraqis O
is O
they O
're O
deeply O
suspicious O
of O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
. O

They O
remember O
that O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
betrayed O
them O
in O
1991 O
. O

The O
U.S B-LOC
. O

did O
n't O
finish O
Saddam O
then O
. O

President O
Bush O
- O
then O
President O
Bush O
called O
on O
them O
to O
rise O
up O
and O
then O
the O
U.S B-LOC
. O

did O
nothing O
and O
so O
they O
're O
deeply O
suspicious O
of O
what O
we O
have O
in O
mind O
. O

WOODRUFF O
Which O
raises O
questions O
going O
forward O
. O

One O
last O
thing O
, O
Ken O
Pollack O
I O
want O
to O
ask O
about O
this O
British B-LOC
officials O
saying O
that O
they O
have O
information O
that O
Saddam O
Hussein O
has O
fired O
his O
air O
defense O
chief O
. O

What O
's O
the O
significance O
of O
that O
? O

POLLACK O
Well O
, O
if O
it O
's O
true O
and O
obviously O
we O
do O
n't O
know O
just O
yet O
but O
if O
it O
's O
true O
, O
it O
is O
very O
significant O
because O
it O
's O
effectively O
the O
Iraqis O
admitting O
that O
many O
of O
the O
civilian O
casualties O
that O
we O
've O
seen O
over O
the O
last O
few O
days O
may O
in O
fact O
have O
been O
caused O
by O
Iraqi B-LOC
surface O
to O
air O
missiles O
falling O
back O
to O
ground O
in O
residential O
areas O
. O

WOODRUFF O
( O
INAUDIBLE O
) O
POLLACK O
Exactly O
, O
in O
that O
market O
and O
I O
think O
it O
was O
pretty O
apparent O
when O
you O
looked O
at O
the O
video O
of O
that O
market O
, O
if O
that O
had O
been O
a O
U.S B-LOC
. O

bomb O
or O
a O
U.S B-LOC
. O

cruise O
missile O
, O
that O
market O
would O
have O
been O
obliterated O
. O

Chances O
are O
it O
was O
an O
Iraqi B-LOC
surface O
to O
air O
missile O
. O

less O

an O
hour O
as O
these O

drop O
these O
massive O
bombs O
on O
the O
Iraqi B-LOC
positions O
behind O
us O

Not O
just O
Iraqi B-LOC
positions O
behind O
us O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
that O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
Mosul B-LOC
as O
well O
which O
is O
a O
major O
northern O
Iraqi B-LOC
city O
about O
28 O
miles O
to O
the O
west O
of O
me O
. O

We O
've O
also O
seen O
some O
massive O
blasts O
to O
the O
south O
as O
well O
so O
it O
appears O
that O
this O
bombing O
in O
this O
area O
continues O
and O
we O
have O
really O
seen O
the O
most O
intense O
bombing O
of O
the O

in O
this O

in O
the O
last O
24 O
hours O

Judy O

WOODRUFF O
Ben O
, O
what O
is O
your O
best O
understanding O
of O
what O
it O
is O
on O
the O
ground O
that O
the O
coalition O
forces O
are O
going O
after O
there O
? O

WEDEMAN O
Well O
, O
basically O
on O
the O
ridge O
itself O
it O
is O
the O
most O
forward O
Iraqi B-LOC
army O
positions O
and O
we O
've O
been O
watching O
them O
very O
closely O
for O
the O
last O
month O
prior O
to O
the O
war O
to O
the O
outbreak O
of O
the O
war O
and O
basically O
these O
are O
the O
positions O
that O
control O
this O
entire O
valley O
. O

Up O
there O
they O
have O
heavy O
machine O
guns O
. O

They O
have O
mortars O
. O

They O
have O
anti-tank O
guns O
, O
hundreds O
of O
men O
along O
this O
very O
long O
ridge O
that O
basically O
runs O
from O
the O
north O
to O
the O
south O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
that O
, O
we O
know O
that O
further O
back O
behind O
those O
lines O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
Mosul B-LOC
there O
is O
heavy O
artillery O
and O
tanks O
as O
well O
, O
this O
according O
to O
the O
people O
here O
in O
this O
area O
, O
the O
local O
Kurds O
who O
have O
been O
going O
across O
the O
lines O
for O
many O
years O
basically O
engaged O
in O
smuggling O
. O

Now O
precisely O
what O
they O
're O
hitting O
to O
the O
south O
of O
us O
is O
unclear O
but O
my O
understanding O
is O
that O
there O
are O
further O
Iraqi B-LOC
positions O
in O
that O
direction O
as O
well O
. O

As O
our O
convoy O
rolled O
through O
southern O
Iraq O
the O
desperation O
of O
the O
people O
here O
soon O
became O
evident O
. O

In O
trucks O
and O
on O
foot O
they O
came O
to O
the O
town O
of O
Safwan B-LOC
. O

These O
people O
have O
been O
without O
food O
or O
water O
supplies O
since O
the O
war O
began O
. O

Now O
they O
are O
desperate O
. O

Within O
seconds O
the O
Kuwaiti B-LOC
aid O
workers O
who O
had O
organized O
this O
trip O
were O
overpowered O
by O
the O
mob O
. O

These O
desperate O
scenes O
are O
exactly O
what O
the O
aide O
agencies O
wanted O
to O
avoid O
. O

This O
is O
survival O
of O
the O
fittest O
. O

Only O
the O
healthy O
and O
strong O
can O
get O
to O
the O
food O
. O

The O
weak O
and O
the O
ill O
are O
left O
with O
nothing O
. O

Despite O
this O
effort O
to O
help O
the O
Iraqi B-LOC
people O
, O
resentment O
is O
never O
far O
away O
. O

UNIDENTIFIED O

GEISSLER O
As O
the O

ran O
out O
the O
mood O
swung O
from O
frantic O

ugly O

Delivery O

were O
threatened O
. O

One O
of O
the O

in O
our O

was O
held O
up O
at O

The O

We O
, O
as O
a O
consequence O
, O
have O
had O
to O
move O
out O
. O

It O
's O
simply O
too O
dangerous O
. O

This O
is O
a O
clear O
indication O
that O
despite O
the O

that O
this O
part O
of O
Iraq B-LOC

safe O
and O
despite O
the O

it O

RUSTY O
DORNIN O
, O
CNN O
CORRESPONDENT O
Well O
Judy O
, O
this O
is O
the O
largest O
group O
really O
we O
've O
seen O
of O
the O
support O
the O
troops O
rallies O
that O
have O
been O
over O
the O
last O
few O
weeks O
. O

Of O
course O
this O
is O
the O
home O
of O
the O
anti- O
war O
demonstrations O
stemming O
back O
to O
the O
Vietnam B-LOC
War O
but O
there O
are O
close O
to O
between O
500 O
and O
1,000 O
people O
. O

I O
'm O
getting O
various O
estimates O
on O
the O
crowd O
. O

We O
did O
want O
to O
show O
you O
an O
interesting O
thing O
here O
. O

Some O
folks O
are O
showing O
some O
solidarity O
with O
the O
speakers O
here O
. O

You O
're O
looking O
at O
some O
of O
San B-LOC
Francisco I-LOC
's O
police O
department O
's O
officers O
. O

I O
did O
ask O
them O
why O
they O
did O
that O
. O

They O
said O
they O
were O
wearing O
skullcaps O
so O
they O
decided O
to O
adopt O
this O
to O
show O
solidarity O
. O

They O
said O
the O
department O
has O
not O
made O
any O
statement O
about O
whether O
they O
think O
that O
's O
all O
right O
or O
not O
. O

This O
has O
been O
a O
very O
peaceful O
demonstration O
. O

As O
I O
said O
, O
the O
officers O
did O
tell O
me O
that O
this O
is O
the O
largest O
pro-troops O
demonstration O
that O
has O
ever O
been O
in O
San B-LOC
Francisco I-LOC
since O
the O
Vietnam B-LOC
War O
. O

So O
far O
, O
very O
peaceful O
. O

As O
I O
said O
, O
there O
have O
been O
a O
few O
verbal O
exchanges O
but O
one O
of O
the O
most O
enthusiastically O
received O
speakers O
here O
was O
Bessam O
Al-Husaini O
, O
an O
Iraqi O
American O
. O

He O
's O
with O
the O
Iraqi B-ORG
American O
Council B-ORG
. O

How O
do O
you O
feel O
about O
supporting O
the O
troops O
? O

How O
does O
the O
Iraqi B-ORG
American O
Council B-ORG
feel O
? O

BESSAM O
AL-HUSAINI O
, O
IRAQI O
AMERICAN O
COUNCIL O
Well O
the O
Iraqi O
American O
have O
been O
waiting O
for O
this O
liberation O
and O
they O
want O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
Saddam O
so O
bad O
and O
they O
will O
have O
to O
take O
it O
the O
way O
it O
's O
been O
offered O
to O
us O
. O

DORNIN O
How O
do O
you O
feel O
though O
seeing O
pictures O
of O
civilians O
injured O
in O
the O
bombings O
? O

AL-HUSAINI O
We O
get O
reports O
that O
these O
civilians O
especially O
in O
the O
( O
INAUDIBLE O
) O
population O
have O
been O
attacked O
by O
the O
Iraqi B-LOC
regime O
themselves O
so O
they O
ca O
n't O
blame O
the O
American O
and O
said O
look O
what O
the O
American O
doing O
to O
us O
. O

He O
would O
love O
to O
see O
this O
and O
would O
draw O
on O
this O
emotion O
from O
the O
Arab O
world O
and O
the O
European B-LOC
country O
. O

DORNIN O
Now O
you O
said O
you O
did O
talk O
to O
your O
family O
in O
Baghdad B-LOC
as O
well O
and O
they O
also O
are O
somewhat O
suspicious O
of O
the O
Americans O
. O

AL-HUSAINI O
Well O
, O
I O
mean O
the O
Iraqi B-LOC
people O
have O
been O
the O
primary O
victim O
from O
the O
whole O
thing O
. O

Yeah O
my O
family O
, O
you O
know O
, O
still O
in O
fear O
. O

You O
know O
they O
stay O
in O
one O
room O
. O

They O
boarded O
all O
the O
- O
all O
the O
windows O
and O
they O
built O
with O
a O
brick O
one O
of O
the O
windows O
facing O
the O
street O
. O

I O
mean O
yes O
, O
you O
know O
, O
my O
prayer O
to O
them O
but O
we O
can O
only O
do O
so O
much O
. O

Hopefully O
it O
will O
be O
a O
short O
war O
. O

It O
will O
be O
attack O
the O
Iraqi B-LOC
regime O
. O

We O
can O
live O
in O
liberty O
and O
freedom O
soon O
. O

DORNIN O
Now O
I O
understand O
some O
of O
the O
people O
here O
have O
been O
threatened O
by O
anti-war O
protesters O
. O

Have O
you O
had O
anyone O
either O
threatening O
you O
or O
... O
AL-HUSAINI O
No O
, O
no O
problem O
. O

This O
has O
been O
a O

DORNIN O
Bessam O

It O
is O
wrapping O
up O
this O

and O
it O
looks O
like O
the O

acts O
by O

that O

in O
. O

This O
is O
the O
kitchen O
, O
when O
we O
're O
down O
, O
and O
we O
're O
very O
fortunate O
, O
because O
we O
've O
got O
a O
teapot O
. O

That O
's O
my O
cubby O
hole O
. O

It O
's O
extraordinary O
cramped O
, O
because O
( O
UNINTELLIGIBLE O
) O
sandbag O
the O
floor O
, O
in O
case O
we O
hit O
a O
mine O
. O

That's O
all O
the O
space O
I O
have O
to O
eat O
and O
sleep O
in O
. O

You O
do O
n't O
sleep O
. O

You O
really O
do O
n't O
sleep O
out O
here O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
you O
're O
on O
an O
adrenaline O
high O
, O
but O
racing O
across O
the O
desert O
, O
you O
know O
that O
you O
're O
traveling O
toward O
the O
jaws O
of O
what O
could O
be O
a O
major O
military O
battle O
. O

You O
have O
to O
realize O
, O
they O
've O
been O
riding O
along O
, O
bouncing O
along O
in O
these O
tanks O
for O
probably O
six O
or O
more O
hours O
now O
. O

And O
if O
you O
ride O
inside O
that O
tank O
, O
it O
is O
like O
riding O
in O
the O
bowels O
of O
a O
dragon O
. O

They O
roar O
, O
they O
screech O
. O

The O
hardest O
part O
of O
the O
trip O
is O
personal O
discomfort O
. O

We O
can O
not O
tell O
you O
the O
levels O
of O
personal O
discomfort O
we O
've O
experienced O
. O

The O
extraordinary O
sandstorms O
, O
the O
bitter O
cold O
nights O
. O

The O
most O
uncomfortable O
thing O
is O
having O
to O
sleep O
sitting O
up O
in O
a O
Humvee O
with O
sandbags O
under O
your O
feet O
, O
your O
knees O
at O
your O
chin O
. O

That O
's O
excruciatingly O
uncomfortable O
, O
not O
something O
that O
you O
would O
wish O
on O
anybody O
but O
a O
contortionist O
. O

Let O
me O
give O
you O
an O
example O
of O
what O
the O
dust O
like O
. O

Look O
at O
this O
. O

We O
have O
been O
through O
days O
of O
dust O
like O
that O
. O

The O
U.S B-ORG

Army B-ORG
's O
7th B-ORG
Cavalry I-ORG
has O
just O
taken O
three O
Iraqi B-LOC
prisoners O
of O

. O

Actually O
, O
they O
're O
very O
close O
, O
that O
is O
to O
say O
, O
no O
more O
than O
40 O
yards O
away O
, O
but O
the O
dust O
and O
sand O
are O
blowing O
so O
badly O
you O
're O
getting O
these O
vague O
images O
. O

It O
's O
like O
being O
in O
a O
blizzard O
, O
except O
unfortunately O
, O
the O
sand O
doesn't O
melt O
as O
the O
snow O
does O
. O

What O
we O
eat O
is O
what O
the O
Army B-ORG
calls O
MREs O
, O
meals O
ready O
to O
eat O
. O

And O
I O
must O
say O
, O
they O
're O
pretty O
darn O
good O
. O

And O
of O
course O
, O
everybody O
fights O
for O
the O
best O
ones O
. O

The O
treats O
are O
things O
like O
the O
M O
& O

; O
Ms O
and O
the O
breakfast O

. O

The O

CORRESPONDENT O
Well O
Judy O
, O
the O
Pentagon B-ORG
is O
beginning O
to O
see O
positive O
signs O
that O
it O
hadn't O
seen O
for O
awhile O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
as O
we O
saw O
just O
a O
few O
moments O
ago O
on O
CNN B-ORG
, O
the O
pictures O
of O
some O
of O
the O
actual O
happy O
Iraqi B-LOC
citizens O
welcoming O
U.S B-LOC
. O

troops O
, O
that O
taking O
place O
in O
Najaf B-LOC
. O

Also O
the O
Pentagon B-ORG
is O
seeing O
lighter O
than O
expected O
resistance O
indicating O
at O
least O
that O
they O
may O
have O
really O
seriously O
degraded O
those O
Republican B-ORG
Guard I-ORG
divisions O
before O
the O
U.S B-LOC
. O

troops O
arrived O
, O
both O
in O
Karbala B-LOC
and O
also O
in O
Al B-LOC
Kut I-LOC
. O

They O
met O
lighter O
than O
expected O
resistance O
. O

But O
the O
Pentagon B-ORG
officials O
stress O
that O
as O
they O
close O
in O
on O
Baghdad B-LOC
, O
this O
becomes O
the O
real O
dangerous O
part O
as O
they O
enter O
that O
so- O
called O
red O
zone O
where O
Saddam O
Hussein O
is O
believed O
to O
have O
given O
his O
commanders O
authority O
to O
use O
chemical O
weapons O
, O
and O
that O
use O
of O
chemical O
weapons O
remains O
a O
real O
fear O
at O
the O
Pentagon O
. O

seize O
it O
in O
a O
coup O
de O

or O
anything O

that O

So O
, O
in O

that O
, O
we O
are O
paying O
great O
attention O
to O
their O
ability O
to O
defend O
on O
the O
ground O
. O

They O
may O
just O
suddenly O
be O
effective O
on O
the O
ground O
. O

Additionally O
, O
their O
ability O
to O
use O
chemical O
and O
biological O
weapons O
, O
they O
've O
proven O
it O
historically O
. O

We O
believe O
they O
have O
the O
capability O
now O
. O

Clearly O
, O
as O
we O
threaten O
the O
core O
of O
the O
regime O
, O
which O
Baghdad B-LOC

Tikrit B-LOC
represent O
, O
we O
believe O
that O
the O
likelihood O
of O
them O
using O
those O
weapons O
goes O
up O

these O
descriptions O
of O
the O

begin O
to O
bring O
back O
memories O
of O
the O
first O
Gulf B-LOC

12 O
years O

. O

Is O
there O
a O
chance O
that O

could O
, O
at O
this O
point O
, O
be O
overestimating O
the O
strength O
of O
what O
's O
left O
of O

? O

MCINTYRE O
Well O
, O
they O
might O
be O
. O

And O
that O
might O
be O
a O
good O
thing O
. O

They O
are O
taking O
it O
very O
cautiously O
. O

No O
one O
, O
again O
, O
they O
stress O
the O
most O
dangerous O
part O
of O
this O
could O
be O
ahead O
. O

Could O
be O
urban O
combat O
. O

Could O
involve O
chemical O
weapons O
. O

Could O
be O
the O
most O
loyal O
fighters O
left O
as O
they O
draw O
into O
Baghdad B-LOC
. O

Could O
be O
a O
very O
dangerous O
time O
. O

They O
also O
are O
careful O
to O
point O
out O
that O
even O
while O
they O
say O
that O
the O
division O
has O
been O
destroyed O
, O
they O
do O
n't O
mean O

Thank O
you O
very O
much O

Judy O

To O
help O
guide O
us O
through O
all O
this O
discussion O
about O
red O

, O
and O
daggers O
and O
exactly O
what O
is O
the O
strength O
of O
the O
Republican B-ORG

we O
turn O
to O
Colonel O
Patrick O

You O

welcome O

O'BRIEN O
What O
do O
you O
suppose O
right O
now O
would O
be O
the O
governor O
on O
the O
forward O
advance O
? O

Is O
it O
the O
Republican B-ORG
Guard I-ORG
or O
is O
it O
the O
U.S B-LOC
. O

and O
coalition O
supply O
lines O
? O

Or O
both O
? O

LANG O
Well O
, O
they O
are O
close O
enough O
up O
to O
Baghdad B-LOC
now O
so O
that O
the O
supply O
line O
issue O
is O
probably O
not O
a O
big O
one O
since O
they O
had O
time O
to O
restock O
, O
food O
, O
fuel O
and O
ammunition O
. O

So O
, O
probably O
the O
main O
thing O
is O
combing O
through O
the O
rubble O
that O
the O
air B-ORG
force I-ORG
has O
left O
of O
these O
Republican B-ORG
Guard I-ORG
divisions O
to O
make O
sure O
there O
are O
no O
strong O
points O
that O
you O
leave O
behind O
, O
that O
could O
threaten O
your O
lines O
of O
supply O
once O
they O
get O
past O
. O

Once O
they O
are O
satisfied O
they O
are O
through O
all O
that O
, O
I O
would O
imaging O
there O
will O
be O
a O
pause O
while O
they O
start O
to O
reconnoiter O
into O
Baghdad B-LOC
, O
probing O
hard O
to O
see O
how O
much O
resistance O
there O
really O
is O
. O

O'BRIEN O
Well O
, O
let O
me O
ask O
you O
that O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
I O
just O
wanted O
to O
tell O
viewers O
where O
we O
just O
took O
our O
satellite O
imagery O
. O

This O
is O
that O
Karbala B-LOC
area O
which O
is O
about O
50 O
miles O
from O
Baghdad B-LOC
. O

Baghdad B-LOC
is O
roughly O
in O
that O
direction O
from O
there O
. O

We O
know O
the O
vanguard O
is O
supposedly O
as O
close O
as O
15 O
miles O
. O

One O
of O
the O
next O
key O
points O
along O
the O
way O
here O
is O
Saddam O
international O
airport O
. O

Do O
you O
suppose O
that O
is O
a O
key O
target O
right O
now O
? O

LANG O
Oh O
, O
I O
'm O
sure O
it O
is O
. O

I O
mean O
a O
feature O
of O
that O
importance O
would O
always O
be O
something O
you O
'd O
want O
to O
hold O
. O

And O
besides O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
you O
get O
control O
of O
it O
you O
'd O
be O
able O
to O
start O
using O
it O
for O
air O
operations O
, O
and O
put O
a O
survey O
team O
in O
there O
as O
soon O
as O
it O
's O
secured O
, O
and O
then O
start O
using O
it O
for O
helicopter O
operations O
, O
haul O
forward O
some O
big O
bladders O
of O
fuel O
to O
refuel O
helicopters O
and O
rearm O
them O
and O
things O
like O
that O
. O

And O
if O
the O
front O
stabilizes O
between O
there O
and O
the O
downtown O
Baghdad O
, O
they O
'll O
start O
using O
it O
for O
a O
fixed O
wing O
aircraft O
as O
well O
. O

O'BRIEN O
Now O
, O
as O
you O
go O
from O
Saddam O
International O
Airport O
into O
town O
you O
see O
there O
are O
some O
big O
, O
wide O
divided O
highways O
there O
. O

Control O
of O
these O
highways O
will O
be O
crucial O
wo O
n't O
it O
? O

LANG O
Yeah O
, O
these O
are O
the O
high-speed O
approaches O
into O
the O
heart O
of O
the O
city O
and O
armored O
forces O
like O
the O
3rd O
Mechanized O
Infantry O
Division O
just O
love O
high-speed O
approaches O
. O

They O
will O
try O
to O
go O
down O
those O
things O
, O
cutting O
the O
city O
up O
into O
sectors O
as O
best O
they O
can O
, O
and O
then O
work O
on O
the O
specific O
sectors O
of O
the O
city O
they O
think O
are O
a O
key O
terrain O
. O

I O
would O
think O
, O
probably O
, O
various O
facilities O
as O
well O
as O
major O
government O
buildings O
that O
they O
need O
to O
control O
to O
set O
up O
a O
new O
government O
. O

O'BRIEN O
It O
's O
a O
big O
city O
, O
about O
the O
size O
of O
Philadelphia B-LOC
or O
thereabouts O
. O

Some O
have O
said O
Chicago B-LOC
is O
a O
good O
analogy O
. O

Tremendous O
amount O
of O
force O
needed O
to O
control O
a O
city O
of O
that O
source O
, O
or O
am O
a O
wrong O
? O

LANG O
Well O
, O
it O
depends O
on O
the O
attitude O
of O
the O
populous O
, O
which O
is O
not O
clear O
yet O
. O

If O
the O
population O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
or O
at O
least O
a O
big O
part O
of O
them O
like O
the O
Shia O
half O
of O
the O
population O
, O
if O
they O
want O
to O
be O
liberated O
, O
then O
you O
can O
control O
them O
with O
a O
fairly O
small O
force O
. O

If O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
in O
the O
city O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
be O
liberated O
and O
you O
're O
never O
going O
to O
know O
that O
until O
you O
try O
, O
then O
you O
're O
going O
to O
need O
a O
much O
larger O
force O
, O
and O
we O
might O
end O
up O
waiting O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
for O
reinforcements O
. O

O'BRIEN O
Based O
on O
what O
you O
've O
seen O
so O
far O
, O
what O
is O
your O
sense O
of O
that O
? O

The O
Shias O
are O
a O
bit O
gun O
shy O
, O
if O
you O
will O
, O
in O
the O
south O
because O
of O
what O
happened O
in O
1991 O
. O

They O
rose O
up O
, O
did O
n't O
get O
American B-LOC
support O
. O

Do O
you O
suppose O
it O
will O
be O
a O
different O
story O
in O
Baghdad B-LOC
? O

Is O
there O
a O
lot O
of O
latent O
hatred O
for O
Saddam O
Hussein O
that O
will O
come O
out O
? O

LANG O
Yes O
, O
there O
is O
, O
but O
these O
folks O
are O
going O
to O
be O
mighty O
cautious O
. O

They O
have O
a O
long O
history O
of O
being O
kicked O
around O
by O
the O
Sunni O
Arab O
population O
of O
central O
Iraq O
. O

And O
they O
do O
n't O
have O
any O
particular O
reason O
to O
trust O
us O
, O
so O
far O
. O

So O
they O
'll O
wait O
and O
see O
what O
happens O
. O

It O
's O
the O
other O
people O
in O

who O

the O

you O

for O
Jessie O

all O
of O

We O
've O
been O
waiting O
all O

word O
from O
the O
doctors O
, O
and O
they O
have O
successively O
done O
one O
surgery O

her O

There O
will O
be O
other O
surgeries O
to O
do O
that O
. O

It O
's O
going O

take O
time O

DEE O
LYNCH O

JESSICA O
'S O
MOTHER O
But O
she O
's O
great O
and O
she O
's O
doing O
good O
. O

G. O
LYNCH O
She O
's O
in O
real O
good O
spirits O
. O

We O
talked O
to O
her O
. O

D. O
LYNCH O
We O
talked O
to O
her O
before O
the O
surgery O
, O
we O
talked O
to O
her O
after O
the O
surgery O
, O
and O
she O
's O
doing O
good O
. O

Ca O
n't O
you O
think O
? O

G. O
LYNCH O
Yes O
, O
a O
bunch O
, O
but O
my O
mind O
's O
blank O
. O

The O
doctor O
has O
completed O
one O
surgery O
on O
her O
back O
. O

They O
have O
released O
the O
pressure O
on O
a O
nerve O
, O
and O
realigned O
all O
the O
disks O
and O
put O
plates O
and O
stuff O
in O
it O
, O
and O
that O
was O
because O
she O
did O
n't O
have O
any O
feeling O
in O
her O
feet O
. O

So O
he O
, O
he O
's O
pretty O
sure O
right O
now O
that O
that O
will O
relieve O
, O
relieve O
the O
tension O
, O
and O
her O
feet O
will O
be O
able O
to O
move O
. O

Also O
, O
we O
have O
heard O
and O
seen O
reports O
that O
she O
had O
multiple O
gunshot O
wounds O
, O
and O
knife O
stabbing O
. O

The O
doctor O
has O
not O
seen O
any O
of O
this O
. O

He O
looked O
for O
the O
gunshot O
wounds O
for O
the O
knife O
stabbing O
, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
injury O
whatsoever O
. O

They O
will O
do O
surgery O
again O
tomorrow O
on O
her O
legs O
. O

She O
has O
fractured O
legs O
and O
her O
right O
forearm O
. O

And O
we O
are O
just O
waiting O
to O
get O
that O
good O
news O
too O
. O

D. O
LYNCH O
We O
talked O
to O
her O
before O
and O
after O
the O
surgery O
, O
like O
I O
said O
, O
and O
she's O
just O
, O
she O
just O
sounded O
real O
good O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
this O
morning O
she O
was O
a O
little O
groggy O
. O

But O
yet O
, O
she O
was O
good O
, O
because O
it O
was O
early O
. O

And O
then O
this O
afternoon O
, O
after O
the O
surgery O
, O
she O
was O
our O
Jessie O
again O
. O

QUESTION O
If O
those O
were O
n't O
gunshot O
wounds O
to O
cause O
the O
broken O
bones O
, O
do O
they O
know O
what O
caused O
the O
fractures O
? O

G. O
LYNCH O
They O
have O
no O
idea O
at O
this O
time O
what O
caused O
them O
. O

We O
know O
she O
's O
in O
good O
spirits O
, O
because O
they O
told O
her O
they O
was O
gon O
na O
put O
pink O
casts O
on O
her O
legs O
and O
arms O
, O
and O
she O
had O
pink O
casts O
when O
she O
was O
in O
the O
third O
grade O
on O
her O
arm O
so O
we O
know O
she O
-- O
her O
mind O
is O
working O
good O
. O

So O
she O
's O
in O
good O
spirits O
, O
and O
we O
hope O
the O
surgery O
will O
go O
good O
tomorrow O
, O
just O
as O
well O
as O
it O
did O
today O
. O

QUESTION O
Can O
you O
tell O
us O
what O
she O
said O
to O
you O
on O
the O
telephone O
? O

You O
said O
she O
was O
in O
good O
spirits O
? O

Can O
you O
describe O
your O
conversation O
? O

G. O
LYNCH O
I O
teased O
her O
again O
about O
the O
Army B-ORG
jeeps O
and O
she O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
know O
where O
there O
's O
a O
bunch O
of O
that O
we O
can O
find O
. O
'' O

So O
, O
we O
know O
she O
's O
in O
good O
spirits O
. O

D. O
LYNCH O
She O
was O
asking O
for O
a O
hairbrush O

, O
the O
father O
of O
Jessica O
Lynch O
, O
and O
Jessica O

mother O
talking O
to O

, O
saying O
they O
have O
talked O
to O
her O
today O
, O
both O
before O
and O
after O
surgery O
, O
that O
she O
says O
she O
's O
feeling O
good O
. O

They O
say O
she O
will O
be O
good O
. O

But O
they O
said O
the O
doctors O
did O
go O
in O
and O
apparently O
do O
some O
work O
on O
her O
spinal O
cord O
or O
spinal O
column O
. O

He O
said O
to O
relieve O
some O
pressure O
on O
a O
nerve O
. O

They O
were O
concerned O
because O
she O
did O
n't O
have O
feeling O
in O
her O
feet O
. O

They O
did O
go O
on O
to O
say O
the O
doctors O
could O
not O
find O
either O
bullet O
or O
knife O
entry O
wounds O
, O
suggesting O
that O
her O
broken O
bones O
came O
from O
some O
other O
source O
, O
and O
it O
is O
not O
clear O
yet O
. O

Her O
parents O
said O
they O
do O
n't O
know O
yet O
what O
caused O
their O

Thanks O
very O
much O

Judy O

And O
Colonel O
Leonhard O
, O
we O
're O
going O
to O
talk O
a O
little O
bit O
about O
urban O
combat O
. O

And O
I O
wanted O
to O
just O
start O
this O
off O
by O
saying O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
when O
they O
hear O
about O
urban O
combat O
, O
they O
think O
of O
that O
Blackhawk O
down O
scenario O
, O
Mogadishu B-LOC
and O
the O
problems O
that O
can O
go O
wrong O
here O
. O

This O
is O
not O
probably O
a O
comparable O
situation O
, O
is O
it O
? O

LT. O
COL. O
ROBERT O
LEONHARD O
, O
U.S. O
ARMY O
( O
RET O
. O
) O

Not O
in O
any O
way O
. O

And O
one O
of O
the O
reasons O
is O
because O
we O
have O
armored O
fighting O
vehicles O
there O
in O
Baghdad B-LOC
, O
and O
we O
will O
use O
them O
. O

Those O
tanks O
have O
120-millimeter O
smoothbore O
gun O
on O
them O
. O

The O
Bradleys O
have O
25-millimetre O
chain O
guns O
and O
coaxial O
machine O
guns O
. O

That O
's O
a O
lot O
of O
mobile O
protective O
gunfire O
. O

Completely O
different O
from O
the O
Mogadishu B-LOC
situation O
in O
which O
we O
did O
not O
have O
such O
vehicles O
. O

And O
we O
also O
are O
not O
going O
to O
use O
similar O
tactics O
there O
. O

We O
are O
much O
more O
likely O
to O
use O
patience O
and O
finesse O
rather O
than O
assault O
tactics O
. O

O'BRIEN O
All O
right O
. O

We O
want O
to O
show O
you O
an O
animation O
, O
and O
share O
with O
our O
viewers O
, O
maybe O
you O
can O
point O
out O
a O
few O
things O
about O
this O
. O

If O
we O
move O
in O
on O
Baghdad B-LOC
, O
and O
give O
you O
a O
sense O
of O
the O
kinds O
of O
targets O
that O
might O
be O
encountered O
in O
urban O
combat O
. O

What O
we O
've O
depicted O
here O
is O
something O
here O
which O
shows O
some O
armor O
sort O
of O
off O
the O
wings O
here O
, O
right O
over O
here O
is O
a O
mosque O
. O

We O
depict O
that O
to O
show O
that O
's O
something O
you O
obviously O
want O
to O
stay O
clear O
as O
we O
just O
saw O
with O
the O
Ryan O
Chilcote O
piece O
from O
Najaf B-LOC
. O

As O
we O
get O
a O
little O
bit O
closer O
here O
, O
in O
a O
typical O
scenario O
like O
this O
, O
you O
might O
very O
well O
have O
Republican B-ORG
Guard I-ORG
snipers O
up O
on O
balconies O
like O
this O
, O
and O
possibly O
up O
on O
the O
roofs O
of O
buildings O
and O
anti-aircraft O
artillery O
or O
artillery O
encampments O
like O
that O
. O

What O
we O
have O
presented O
her O
is O
an O
armored O
column O
with O
air O
support O
coming O
in O
. O

How O
much O
jeopardy O
is O
a O
column O
like O
this O
in O
as O
it O
goes O
through O
these O
concrete O
canyons O
in O
a O
city O
? O

LEONHARD O
It O
's O
a O
great O
question O
. O

I O
think O
the O
animation O
is O
good O
because O
it O
does O
show O
that O
you O
can O
hide O
literally O
anywhere O
in O
a O
city O
environment O
, O
and O
that O
is O
why O
movement O
through O
an O
urban O
area O
is O
very O
, O
very O
dangerous O
. O

It O
's O
the O
side O
that O
's O
moving O
that O
's O
going O
to O
take O
the O
casualties O
. O

That O
said O
, O
the O
armored O
fighting O
vehicles O
that O
you O
see O
there O
they O
look O
to O
me O
as O
if O
they O
're O
moving O
a O
little O
bit O
faster O
as O
than O
we O
probably O
will O
. O

We O
'll O
use O
patience O
and O
finesse O
. O

We O
will O
take O
the O
time O
to O
locate O
the O
enemy O
, O
surround O
the O
blocks O
and O
the O
buildings O
that O
he O
is O
in O
. O

And O
then O
we O
'll O
probably O
surge O
fires O
into O
their O
both O
lethal O
and O
nonlethal O
to O
make O
his O
position O
untenable O
, O
to O
make O
him O
move O
rather O
than O
us O
moving O
through O
the O
assault O
zone O
. O

At O
which O
time O
we O
can O
engage O
them O
or O
arrest O
them O
. O

O'BRIEN O
We O
'd O
like O
to O
resume O
with O
that O
animation O
if O
we O
could O
. O

That O
's O
Saddam O
International O
Airport O
. O

That O
's O
another O
segment O
. O

Can O
we O
get O
back O
to O
the O
animation O
. O

And O
I O
'd O
like O
to O
just O
finish O
this O
out O
. O

Here O
we O
go O
. O

Ad O
we O
move O
it O
along O
, O
you O
'll O
see O
eventually O
the O
troops O
will O
come O
marching O
in O
. O

In O
this O
case O
, O
slightly O
off O
target O
here O
because O
you O
see O
them O
all O
going O
in O
the O
front O
door O
. O

Typically O
, O
when O
they O
'd O
assault O
a O
target O
like O
this O
, O
they O
'd O
do O
what O
? O

LEONHARD O
Well O
, O
typically O
, O
if O
they O
do O
go O
in O
, O
which O
is O
generally O
the O
option O
of O
last O
resort O
, O
but O
if O
we O
do O
have O
to O
go O
in O
, O
often O
we O
'll O
try O
to O
go O
in O
from O
the O
top O
of O
the O
building O
down O
. O

One O
of O
the O
reasons O
is O
because O
we O
use O
grenades O
a O
lot O
in O
clearing O
buildings O
, O
and O
grenades O
ten O
to O
offend O
downhill O
rather O
than O
uphill O
. O

So O
, O
you O
always O
want O
them O
going O
down O
staircases O
rather O
than O
having O
to O
try O
to O
throw O
them O
up O
the O
staircase O
. O

O'BRIEN O

, O
all O

would O
prefer O

left O

they O
done O

much O

the O

of O

a O

they O
have O

, O

, O
of O

, O
they O
would O
prefer O
to O

For O
more O
now O
on O
the O
unique O

You O
know O
, O
just O
those O
two O
words O
together O
, O
I O
think O
, O
scare O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
because O
of O
all O
the O
things O
that O
can O
go O
wrong O
. O

You O
know O
, O
I O
'm O
impressed O
, O
looking O
at O
this O
map O
, O
it O
almost O
looks O
like O
a O
chess O
game O
, O
kind O
of O
sterile O
. O

That O
is O
-- O
could O
n't O
be O
further O

, O
could O
it O
? O

This O
is O
very O
clean O
and O
it O

very O
orderly O
. O

Suddenly O
when O
we O
show O
the O
videotape O
and O
we O
start O
to O
go O
there O
, O
you O
'll O
see O
just O
how O
conflicted O
an O
environment O
that O
is O
. O

O'BRIEN O
And O
all O
happening O
so O
quickly O
. O

MCCANN O
( O
UNINTELLIGIBLE O

. O

O'BRIEN O
Let O
's O
roll O
some O
tape O
. O

We O
're O
going O
to O
kind O
of O
play O
it O
and O
stop O
it O
, O

going O
to O
walk O
us O
through O
, O
I O

, O
Urban O

. O

What O
are O
we O
seeing O
here O
? O

MCCANN O
Just O
there O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
just O
getting O
the O
door O
out O
of O
the O
way O
, O
you O
can O
see O
where O
the O
weapons O
have O
to O
go O
. O

Now O
, O
you O
just O
see O
this O
soldier O
right O
here O
, O
he O
's O
going O
to O
his O
sidearm O
to O
make O
a O
little O
bit O
more O
mobile O
. O

And O
he O
's O
got O
to O
be O
careful O
of O
his O
muzzle O
pointing O
at O
his O
partner O
right O
here O
. O

Now O
, O
he's O
going O
to O
go O
that O
direction O
, O
because O
that O
room O
is O
clear O
. O

Go O
ahead O
and O
stop O
the O
tape.As O
you O
make O
every O
entry O
, O
Miles O
, O
there O
are O
two O
dead O
spots O
, O
one O
, O
of O
course O
, O
in O
this O
direction O
right O
here O
, O
which O
you O
ca O
n't O
see O
from O
the O
doorway O
, O
the O
other O
in O
this O
direction O
right O
here O
, O
and O
that O
's O
always O
the O
problem O
, O
because O
as O
you O
come O
in O
here O
, O
you O
've O
got O
to O
be O
able O
to O
get O
in O
there O
quickly O
and O
make O
sure O
that O
this O
person O
here O
does O
n't O
get O
shot O
in O
the O
back O
. O

So O
... O
O'BRIEN O
All O
right O
. O

Now O
, O
what O
about O
this O
, O
this O
armor O
? O

Tell O
us O
how O
they O
're O
equipped O
with O
armor O
there O
. O

MCCANN O
Level O
4 O
armor O
, O
this O
is O
not O
just O
for O
frag O
. O

This O
will O
also O
stop O
bullets O
. O

And O
there O
's O
a O
difference O
. O

The O
normal O
flak O
jacket O
will O
stop O
fragments O
from O
grenades O
, O
et O
cetera O
. O

This O
is O
a O
plate O
that O
will O
actually O
stop O
and O
deform O
a O
bullet O
. O

O'BRIEN O
All O
right O
. O

Let O
's O
roll O
tape O
and O
continue O
on O
here O
and O
talk O
about O
-- O
Now O
, O
I O
notice O
his O
hand O
-- O
his O
sidearm O
is O
attached O
to O
him O

That O
's O

So O
he O
goes O
down O
the O
hallway O
, O
and O
you O
can O
see O
once O
that O
's O
called O
clear O
, O
straight O

finger O
, O
in O
case O
there O
's O
any O
sympathetic O
muscle O
tightening O
, O
there O
's O
no O
problem O
. O

You O
'll O
see O
another O
person O
come O
right O
up O
here O
, O
and O
he O
'll O
hold O
on O
this O
door O
, O
because O
that O
's O
not O
been O
cleared O
space O
yet O
, O
again O
, O
straight O

, O
but O
ready O
to O
shoot O
if O
he O
needs O
to O
. O

O'BRIEN O

not O

the O
room O
out O

getting O
angles O
of O

as O
they O
clear O
it O

But O
look O
at O
that O
, O
a O
dark O
space O
from O
a O
lighted O

Who O
knows O
what O
's O
in O
the O

O'BRIEN O
All O

Let O
's O
roll O
that O
second O

quickly O
, O
and O
we O
'll O
show O
you O
a O
couple O
more O
tips O
from O
Kelly O

So O
far O
, O
what O
we O

seeing O
is O
pretty O

MCCANN O
Absolutely O

( O

O'BRIEN O
All O
right O

Now O
, O
this O
is O
a O
rural O

but O
this O
could O
be O
applied O
to O
urban O
combat O
, O
yes O
. O

MCCANN O
Very O
different O
circumstance O

Same O
thing O
when O
you O
come O
into O
a O

But O
stop O

here O
... O
O'BRIEN O
Oop O

we O

we O

MCCANN O

if O
you O
would O

( O
UNINTELLIGIBLE O

It O
's O
all O
right O

You O
can O

all O
this O

O'BRIEN O
No O
, O
just O
roll O
it O

MCCANN O

out O
here O

Just O
go O

roll O
it O

All O
of O
that O
has O
to O
be O
accounted O
for O
as O

the O

Your O

Many O
angles O
you O
've O

Now O

he O

got O
a O
sidearm O

he O
's O
calling O
the O

All O

Now O
, O
stop O

O'BRIEN O
Yes O

( O

MCCANN O
Imagine O
a O
person O
that O
is O
concealed O
anywhere O
in O
here O

I O
mean O
, O
you O
could O
have O
anyone O

O'BRIEN O
No O

he O
would O

But O
let O
me O
ask O
you O
this O
. O

Also O
that O
the O
garb O

( O

there O
's O
a O
cultural O
issue O

That O
provides O
a O
lot O
of O
cover O
for O
weapons O
if O
need O
be O
, O
right O
? O

MCCANN O
Absolutely O

And O
someones O
might O
say O
, O
Well O
, O
why O
put O
their O

Because O

what O
do O
they O

O'BRIEN O
All O

Let O

it O
real O
quickly O
and O
we O
'll O
make O
a O

more O
points O

if O
we O
could O

A O

You O

by O
the O

they O

That O

All O

Now O
you O
've O

coming O
down O

Look O

the O

They O

thought O

a O
real O

experience O

ROBERTS O
And O
she O
says O
: O

UNIDENTIFIED O

For O

You O
might O
want O

well O

KAGAN O
This O
time O
, O
they O
hope O
the O

will O
write O
back O
with O
answers O
to O
their O

CUPOLO O
So O
you O
want O
to O
know O
how O
fast O
the O

OK O

I O
would O

Well O
, O
Laith O
Kubba O
is O
an O
Iraqi B-LOC
exile O
who O
has O
family O
members O
in O
Iraq B-LOC

Mr. O
Kubba O
is O
a O
senior O
fellow O
at O
a O
think O

called O
the O
National B-ORG
Endowment O
for O

He O

the O

of O
a O
group O
of O
Iraqi B-LOC

, O
a O
group O
called O
the O
Iraq B-ORG
National O
Group B-ORG
. O

He O
joins O
us O
now O
from O
London B-LOC
to O
talk O
about O
rebuilding O
his O
country O
. O

Mr. O
Kubba O
, O
first O
of O
all O
, O
your O
thoughts O
as O
you O
've O
watched O
these O
scenes O
of O
Baghdad B-LOC
, O
the O
Saddam O
Hussein O
regime O
falling O
in O
the O
last O
day O
? O

LAITH O
KUBBA O
, O
PRESIDENT O
, O
IRAQI B-ORG
NATIONAL O
GROUP B-ORG
It O
is O
a O
huge O
sigh O
of O
relief O
, O
because O
it O
could O
have O
been O
much O
worse O
and O
Baghdad B-LOC
could O
have O
been O
a O
war O
theater O
with O
more O
destruction O
to O
property O
. O

And O
, O
obviously O
, O
there O
are O
four O
million O
people O
who O
could O
have O
suffered O
more O
. O

So O
, O
there O
is O
a O
sigh O
of O
relief O
that O
it O
is O
not O
worse O
. O

But O
, O
obviously O
, O
there O
is O
a O
great O
, O
great O
concern O
about O
the O
scenes O
that O
you O
've O
been O
showing O
on O
television O
. O

WOODRUFF O
Are O
you O
talking O
to O
family O
members O
now O
in O
Baghdad B-LOC
and O
around O
Iraq B-LOC
? O

And O
, O
if O
you O
are O
, O
how O
concerned O
are O
they O
about O
the O
lawlessness O
? O

KUBBA O
Well O
, O
not O
in O
the O
recent O
three O
or O
four O
days O
. O

There O
are O
no O
phone O
lines O
to O
Baghdad B-LOC
. O

In O
other O
parts O
of O
Iraq B-LOC
, O
I O
received O
with O
great O
sadness O
the O
killing O
of O
one O
close O
colleague O
, O
Saeed O
Abu O
Naji O
Abhuey O
( O
ph O
) O
in O
Najaf B-LOC

He O
was O
not O
killed O
by O
former O
members O
of O
the O
Baath B-ORG
Party I-ORG
or O
the O
security O
of O
the O
army O
, O
but O
by O
just O
a O
local O
organized O
group O
. O

So O
those O
signs O
to O
me O
are O
worrying O
. O

People O
are O
sensing O
and O
feeling O
the O
lack O
of O
authority O
or O
the O
power O
vacuum O
and O
are O
testing O
it O
. O

And O
the O
more O
they O
test O
, O
the O
more O
I O
think O
they O
are O
claiming O
. O

WOODRUFF O
How O
difficult O
will O
it O
be O
to O
sort O
out O
who O
will O
next O
hold O
power O
in O
Iraq B-LOC
after O
this O
transition O
period O
, O
however O
long O
it O
is O
, O
where O
the O
U.S B-LOC
. O

is O
in O
charge O
? O

KUBBA O
Well O
, O
one O
needs O
to O
break O
down O
this O
process O
into O
various O
elements O
. O

Today O
, O
there O
should O
be O
an O
authority O
. O

And O
it O
's O
very O
likely O
that O
the O
U.S B-LOC
. O

and O
the O
British B-LOC
forces O
are O
the O
authority O
on O
land O
. O

And O
there O
ought O
to O
be O
administration O
. O

And O
this O
ought O
to O
be O
primarily O
by O
Iraqis O
. O

But O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
government O
, O
I O
think O
we O
really O
need O
to O
map O
out O
step O
by O
step O
how O
to O
move O
from O
this O
power O
vacuum O
to O
the O
day O
we O
have O
elections O
. O

We O
need O
to O
involve O
the O
U.N B-ORG
. O

We O
need O
to O
involve O
all O
Iraqi B-LOC
forces O
in O
the O
country O
, O
outside O
the O
country O
. O

But O
we O
need O
to O
do O
it O
quickly O
, O
because O
every O
day O
passes O
by O
with O
this O
vacuum O
, O
it O
's O
going O
to O
spell O
trouble O
. O

WOODRUFF O
Well O
, O
we O
know O
, O
Mr. O
Kubba O
, O
there O
are O
several O
Iraqi B-LOC
exiles O
groups O
competing O
for O
influence O
. O

Is O
one O
of O
them O
going O
to O
have O
an O
advantage O
? O

And O
, O
particularly O
, O
I O
have O
in O
mind O
the O
Iraqi B-ORG
National O
Congress B-ORG
that O
Mr. O
Chalabi O
, O
who O
was O
assisted O
by O
U.S B-LOC
. O

forces O
in O
getting O
back O
into O
Iraq B-LOC
? O

KUBBA O
I O
think O
it O
's O
one O
thing O
to O
gain O
fame O
and O
access O
to O
Washington B-LOC
. O

It's O
totally O
another O
to O
gain O
legitimacy O
and O
functioning O
grounds O
inside O
Iraq B-LOC
. O

And O
I O
think O
plans O
must O
not O
be O
drawn O
in O
thin O
air O
out O
in O
Washington B-LOC
. O

It O
must O
really O
be O
drawn O
on O
the O
ground O
inside O
Iraq B-LOC
. O

And O
there O
are O
22 O
million O
people O
there O
. O

It O
's O
not O
a O
void O
. O

It O
's O
not O
a O
vacuum O
. O

And O
I O
think O
all O
plans O
must O
be O
anchored O
there O
in O
Iraq B-LOC
in O
its O
reality O
. O

WOODRUFF O
So O
does O
one O
group O
have O
an O
advantage O
over O
another O
now O
? O

KUBBA O
There O
are O
different O
groups O
who O
have O
advantage O
over O
others O
in O
different O
parts O
of O
the O
country O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
we O
do O
not O
have O
a O
national O
group O
that O
can O
appeal O
to O
Iraqis O
as O
Iraqis O
within O
a O
credible O
voice.This O
needs O
to O
be O
constructed O
, O
maybe O
through O
a O
conference O
to O
be O
held O
in O
Baghdad B-LOC
, O
where O
representatives O
from O
provinces O
all O
over O
Iraq B-LOC
need O
to O
participate O
, O
as O
well O
as O
political O
groups O
. O

But O
we O
do O
not O
have O
a O
single O
group O
, O
a O
single O
leadership O
or O
a O
single O
council O
yet O

Welcome O
back O

LATE O
EDITION O

We O
return O
now O
to O
my O
interview O
earlier O
today O
with O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
defense O
secretary O
, O
Donald O
Rumsfeld O
. O

( O
BEGIN O
VIDEOTAPE O
) O
BLITZER O
I O
know O
during O
the O
war O
, O
before O
the O
war O
, O
you O
were O
very O
concerned O
about O
the O
position O
of O
the O
Syrian B-LOC
government O
, O
cooperating O
with O
Iraqis O
, O
having O
an O
open O
border O
, O
if O
you O
will O
. O

Has O
the O
situation O
improved O
, O
especially O
in O
the O
aftermath O
now O
of O
the O
secretary O
of O
state O
's O
meeting O
with O
Bashar O
al-Asad O
? O

RUMSFELD O
Well O
, O
I O
guess O
time O
will O
tell O
. O

I O
talked O
to O
Secretary O
Powell O
this O
morning O
on O
the O
phone O
a O
bit O
, O
and O
it O
's O
not O
, O
I O
think O
you O
need O
to O
let O
the O
dust O
settle O
on O
that O
. O

He O
's O
, O
in O
my O
judgment O
, O
had O
a O
visit O
that O
was O
worth O
doing O
, O
and O
the O
president O
asked O
him O
to O
do O
it O
, O
and O
it O
was O
the O
right O
thing O
to O
do O
. O

We O
'll O
see O
what O
progress O
comes O
. O

You O
know O
, O
words O
are O
one O
thing O
, O
actions O
are O
another O
. O

BLITZER O
But O
right O
now O
you O
're O
open-minded O
as O
far O
as O
Syria B-LOC
on O
whether O
they O
will O
crack O
down O
on O
terrorism O
, O
take O
some O
of O
the O
other O
steps O
that O
you O
want O
them O
to O
take O
? O

RUMSFELD O
I O
know O
what O
they O
've O
been O
doing O
, O
and O
it O
's O
been O
unhelpful O
. O

I O
know O
that O
Secretary O
Powell O
was O
just O
there O
and O
advised O
them O
that O
it O
was O
unhelpful O
, O
and O
gave O
them O
some O
pointers O
and O
some O
suggestions O
for O
the O
future O
. O

In O
my O
view O
, O
they O
were O
making O
some O
unwise O
decisions O
previously O
. O

What O
they O
'll O
do O
after O
this O
visit O
remains O
to O
be O
seen O
. O

BLITZER O
The O
secretary O
of O
state O
has O
written O
you O
a O
letter O
expressing O
, O
apparently O
, O
some O
concern O
about O
the O
length O
that O
the O
prisoners O
are O
going O
to O
be O
spending O
, O
those O
detained O
at O
the O
U.S B-LOC
. O

Naval O
base O
at O
Guantanamo B-LOC
Bay I-LOC
in O
Cuba B-LOC
, O
about O
600 O
or O
so O
of O
them O
. O

Is O
there O
any O
movement O
in O
trying O
to O
determine O
the O
fate O
of O
these O
individuals O
? O

RUMSFELD O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
that O
's O
quite O
accurate O
as O
to O
what O
he O
wrote O
me O
about O
. O

BLITZER O
All O
right O
, O
tell O
me O
what O
... O
RUMSFELD O
I O
think O
what O
he O
wrote O
me O
about O
was O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
inter-agency O
process O
, O
where O
we O
have O
all O
these O
FBI B-ORG
and O
Department B-ORG
of O
Justice O
and O
CIA B-ORG
and O
DIA B-ORG
, O
and O
what O
have O
you O
, O
involved O
in O
interrogating O
these O
detainees O
, O
it O
takes O
time O
to O
find O
out O
what O
intelligence O
they O
have O
. O

It O
also O
takes O
time O
to O
figure O
out O
what O
law O
enforcement O
process O
might O
be O
appropriate O
, O
and O
what O
Colin O
and O
I O
have O
been O
concerned O
about O
, O
both O
of O
us O
, O
is O
that O
it O
's O
taking O
so O
long O
. O

There O
are O
a O
number O
of O
countries O
, O
and O
the O
Department B-ORG
of O
State B-ORG
has O
the O
responsibility O
of O
dealing O
with O
those O
countries O
, O
that O
have O
foreign O
nationals O
in O
Gitmo B-LOC
, O
in O
Guantanamo B-LOC
Bay I-LOC
, O
Cuba B-LOC
, O
being O
detained O
, O
and O
those O
countries O
, O
understandably O
, O
would O
like O
to O
know O
when O
they O
could O
have O
those O
people.So O
the O
inter-agency O
process O
takes O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
time O
. O

Colin O
and O
I O
are O
trying O
to O
speed O
up O
that O
process O
, O
and O
that O
's O
what O
that O
's O
all O
about O
. O

BLITZER O
Let O
me O
just O
, O
a O
couple O
of O
nuggets O
to O
sort O
of O
wrap O
up O
before O
I O
let O
you O
go O
. O

Victory O
parades O
for O
the O
troops O
. O

I O
remember O
covering O
General O
Schwarzkopf O
, O
the O
parades O
in O
Washington B-LOC
and O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
after O
the O
first O
Gulf B-LOC
War O
. O

Do O
you O
want O
the O
troops O
to O
be O
honored O
in O
that O
way O
when O
they O
come O
back O
, O
to O
have O
parades O
in O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
, O
Washington B-LOC
, O
elsewhere O
? O

RUMSFELD O
There O
's O
no O
question O
but O
that O
the O
troops O
, O
the O
young O
men O
and O
women O
, O
did O
such O
a O
superb O
job O
that O
there O
has O
to O
be O
a O
way O
to O
honor O
them O
, O
and O
there O
will O
be O
. O

And O
General O
Franks O
and O
his O
team O
have O
done O
just O
a O
superb O
job O
for O
our O
country O
and O
for O
the O
world O
, O
and O
indeed O
for O
the O
Iraqi B-LOC
people O
, O
who O
have O
been O
liberated O
. O

What O
's O
the O
best O
way O
to O
do O
that O
? O

In O
the O
case O
of O
1991 O
, O
the O
task O
was O
to O
go O
in O
and O
get O
them O
out O
of O
Kuwait B-LOC
, O
and O
they O
did O
it O
, O
and O
they O
were O
properly O
greeted O
coming O
back O
to O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
. O

In O
this O
instance O
, O
it O
was O
a O
very O
different O
task O
. O

It O
was O
to O
remove O
that O
regime O
, O
and O
it O
's O
part O
of O
a O
global O
war O
on O
terrorism O
that O
is O
not O
over O
. O

We O
still O
have O
to O
face O
the O
problem O
of O
a O
number O
of O
global O
terrorist O
networks O
and O
terrorist O
states O
that O
exist O
, O
that O
work O
with O
those O
global O
networks O
. O

And O
on O
the O
one O
hand O
we O
will O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
find O
a O
way O
to O
honor O
the O
courage O
and O
dedication O
and O
talent O
of O
these O
young O
men O
and O
women O
, O
and O
we O
'll O
do O
it O
well O
. O

Whether O
it O
will O
be O
modeled O
off O
the O
1991 O
thing O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

I O
kind O
of O
doubt O
it O
, O
because O
it O
's O
such O
a O
different O
circumstance O
. O

Certainly O
, O
our O
war O
plan O
was O
not O
modeled O
off O
of O
1991 O
. O

BLITZER O
One O
final O
question O
on O
North B-LOC
Korea I-LOC
. O

If O
the O
North B-LOC
Koreans I-LOC
pursue O
their O
nuclear O
weapons O
ambitions O
... O
RUMSFELD O
Yes O
. O

BLITZER O
... O
a O
preemptive O
strike O
, O
is O
that O
something O
that O
is O
out O
there O
? O

RUMSFELD O
I O
'm O
not O
one O
who O
speculates O
about O
things O
like O
that O
. O

I O
know O
that O
back O
in O
the O
1990s O
, O
in O
the O
Clinton O
administration O
, O
Secretary O
Perry O
called O
in O
the O
former O
secretaries O
of O
defense O
, O
and O
we O
had O
a O
discussion O
, O
and O
they O
clearly O
had O
teed O
up O
a O
military O
option O
that O
they O
were O
considering O
, O
and O
they O
then O
at O
a O
certain O
moment O
were O
able O
to O
do O
some O
things O
that O
persuaded O
them O
that O
that O
was O
not O
appropriate O
. O

But O
those O
are O
very O
serious O
issues O
, O
and O
I O
leave O
them O
for O

Senators O

welcome O
back O
to O
LATE O
EDITION O

Mr. O
Chairman O
, O
let O
me O
begin O
with O
you O
. O

Are O
you O
among O
those O
who O
are O
beginning O
to O
conclude O
that O
, O
when O
all O
the O
dust O
settles O
, O
the O
U.S B-LOC

may O
not O
find O
weapons O

SEN. O
RICHARD O
LUGAR O
( O
R O
) O
, O
INDIANA O
No O
, O
I O
concur O
with O
Secretary O
Powell O
, O
Secretary O
Rumsfeld O
, O
the O
president O
, O
that O
weapons O
of O
mass O
destruction O
are O
there O
, O
and O
likewise O
, O
that O
we O
will O
be O
led O
to O
them O
by O
people O
knowledgeable O
in O
the O
country O
as O
to O
where O
they O
are O
. O

What O
form O
we O
may O
find O
them O
and O
what O
traces O
of O
destruction O
and O
all O
the O
rest O
of O
it O
will O
be O
very O
interesting O
and O
, O
likewise O
, O
the O
intellectual O
capital O
that O
is O
there O
to O
produce O
more O
. O

Because O
not O
much O
else O
is O
-- O
you O
do O
n't O
need O
much O
to O
get O
it O
going O
again O
. O

And O
that O
, O
I O
think O
, O
we O
have O
to O
be O
working O
with O
these O
people O
who O
are O
in O
the O
business O
to O
make O
sure O
they O
don't O
re-enter O
the O
business O
, O
much O
as O
we O
did O
with O
Russian B-LOC
scientists O
under O
the O
Nunn-Lugar O
program O
. O

BLITZER O
What O
about O
you O
, O
Senator O
Dodd O
, O
do O
you O
believe O
, O
in O
the O
end O
, O
they O
will O
find O
weapons O
of O
mass O
destruction O
? O

SEN. O
CHRISTOPHER O
DODD O
( O
D O
) O
, O
CONNECTICUT O
I O
have O
no O
evidence O
to O
the O
contrary O
. O

And O
certainly O
, O
they O
have O
used O
them O
in O
the O
past O
. O

There O
's O
no O
doubt O
about O
that O
at O
all O
, O
both O
in O
Iran B-LOC
and O
against O
the O
Kurdish O
population O
. O

So O
, O
whether O
or O
not O
they O
find O
them O
in O
the O
exact O
form O
that O
many O
would O
assume O
they O
would O
be O
the O
case O
-- O
possibly O
some O
got O
out O
of O
the O
country O
. O

It O
would O
n't O
surprise O
me O
to O
hear O
that O
. O

But O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
work O
on O
the O
assumption O
, O
based O
on O
the O
intelligence O
that O
has O
been O
gathered O
, O
that O
the O
weapons O
of O
mass O
destruction O
existed O
. O

BLITZER O
What O
if O
they O
do O
n't O
? O

DODD O
Well O
, O
you O
know O
, O
they O
've O
used O
it O
in O
the O
past O
, O
and O
I O
think O
the O
point O
that O
Senator O
Lugar O
just O
made O
-- O
certainly O
having O
the O
intellectual O
capacity O
to O
do O
this O
was O
proven O
already O
by O
the O
fact O
they O
've O
used O
them O
in O
the O
past O
. O

So O
, O
I O
would O
n't O
dwell O
on O
that O
point O
specifically O
, O
because O
Saddam O
Hussein O
clearly O
was O
a O
producer O
and O
a O
user O
of O
biological O
and O
chemical O
weapons O
. O

He O
clearly O
was O
on O
the O
track O
to O
acquire O
a O
nuclear O
capacity O
, O
and O
the O
world O
is O
a O
safer O
place O
today O
because O
he O
's O
not O
ruling O
Iraq B-LOC
. O

BLITZER O
Will O
the O
U.S B-LOC
. O

lose O
creditability O
, O
Mr. O
Chairman O
, O
if O
, O
if O
the O
U.S B-LOC
. O

finds O
no O
hard O
evidence O
, O
no O
so-called O
smoking O
gun O
? O

LUGAR O
No O
, O
we O
have O
full O
credibility O
in O
Iraq B-LOC
. O

We O
've O
prosecuted O
with O
the O
alliance O
a O
successful O
liberation O
of O
the O
Iraqi B-LOC
people O
, O
and O
we O
have O
clearly O
caused O
Saddam O
to O
destroy O
weapons O
of O
mass O
destruction O
, O
or O
at O
least O
to O
suppress O
evidence O
of O
them O
. O

That O
is O
a O
victory O
of O
sorts.This O
is O
a O
facet O
that's O
important O
. O

It O
's O
important O
in O
the O
war O
against O
terrorism O
that O
we O
rout O
out O
whatever O
is O
there O
and O
, O
likewise O
, O
the O
people O
involved O
, O
because O
they O
might O
help O
supply O
al B-ORG
Qaeda I-ORG
or O
other O
terrorists O
along O
the O
trail O
. O

BLITZER O
Senator O
Dodd O
, O
how O
important O
is O
it O
for O
the O
U.S B-LOC
. O

to O
conclusively O
learn O
what O
happened O
to O
Saddam O
Hussein O
? O

DODD O
Well O
, O
it O
's O
important O
. O

But O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
's O
as O
important O
as O
finding O
Osama O
bin O
Laden O
, O
for O
the O
simple O
reason O
that O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
Saddam O
Hussein O
today O
poses O
any O
threat O
, O
wherever O
he O
is O
. O

If O
he O
is O
alive O
, O
obviously O
, O
he O
does O
n't O
pose O
the O
kind O
of O
threat O
that O
an O
Osama O
bin O
Laden O
does O
with O
his O
cellular O
network O
around O
the O
world O
to O
reactivate O
al B-ORG
Qaeda I-ORG
and O
international O
terrorism O
. O

So O
, O
it O
would O
certainly O
be O
good O
to O
know O
where O
he O
is O
. O

It O
would O
be O
, O
certainly O
, O
to O
know O
, O
to O
apprehend O
him O
, O
to O
bring O
him O
before O
a O
court O
of O
justice O
. O

But O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
's O
absolutely O
critical O
for O
the O
ultimate O
success O
of O
this O
mission O
that O
we O
apprehend O
him O
or O
find O
out O
what O
happened O
to O
him O
. O

BLITZER O
And O
you O
agree O
with O
that O
assessment O
, O
Mr. O
Chairman O
? O

LUGAR O
Yes O
, O
I O
think O
that O
Senator O
Dodd O
is O
right O
on O
. O

-DOCSTART- O

BLITZER O
What O
about O
the O
length O
of O
the O
U.S B-LOC
. O

military O
presence O
in O
Iraq B-LOC
, O
Senator O
Lugar O
? O

How O
long O
do O
you O
anticipate O
large O
numbers O
of O
U.S B-LOC
. O

troops O
will O
remain O
there O
? O

LUGAR O
Well O
, O
I O
was O
heartened O
by O
what O
Secretary O
Rumsfeld O
told O
you O
in O
the O
last O
interview O
, O
that O
we O
will O
have O
troops O
there O
as O
long O
as O
necessary O
, O
but O
no O
longer O
than O
necessary O
. O

I O
think O
that O
's O
a O
pretty O
good O
way O
to O
state O
it O
. O

My O
own O
view O
is O
that O
the O
security O
of O
the O
country O
clearly O
is O
our O
responsibility O
presently O
. O

We O
are O
trying O
to O
pass O
that O
on O
to O
others O
. O

Likewise O
, O
the O
other O
government O
's O
procedures O
, O
the O
fledgling O
beginnings O
on O
democracy O
, O
and O
all O
the O
rest O
. O

But O
that O
's O
going O
to O
require O
an O
undergirding O
. O

Now O
, O
in O
due O
course O
, O
as O
everybody O
points O
out O
, O
we O
may O
get O
help O
from O
other O
countries O
. O

We O
may O
bring O
in O
NATO B-ORG
allies O
or O
the O
United B-ORG
Nations I-ORG
or O
other O
people O
in O
the O
Arab O
world O
. O

That O
would O
be O
helpful O
. O

But O
for O
the O
moment O
, O
this O
is O
our O
responsibility O
. O

And O
we O
ought O
not O
to O
be O
having O
large O
debates O
about O
how O
rapidly O
we O
move O
out O
. O

And O
I O
was O
upset O
, O
in O
a O
way O
, O
to O
hear O
reports O
that O
by O
the O
fall O
, O
three O
divisions O
out O
of O
five O
would O
be O
gone O
. O

I O
think O
Secretary O
Rumsfeld O
disabused O
us O
of O
that O
today O
. O

BLITZER O
And O
what O
about O
you O
, O
Senator O
Dodd O
, O
not O
only O
the O
length O
of O
time O
, O
but O
the O
cost O
to O
U.S B-LOC
. O

taxpayers O
? O

Have O
you O
been O
given O
any O
ballpark O
estimate O
what O
this O
is O
going O
to O
cost O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
? O

DODD O
No O
. O

Well O
, O
what O
we O
've O
heard O
the O
numbers O
of O
reconstruction O
running O
around O
$ O
100 O
billion O
. O

We O
put O
$ O
2.5 O
billion O
in O
, O
in O
the O
last O
supplemental O
appropriations O
bill O
. O

So O
it O
's O
going O
to O
be O
costly O
. O

These O
RFPs O
, O
these O
seeking O
bids O
on O
various O
contracts O
are O
rather O
costly O
, O
and O
so O
it O
's O
going O
to O
be O
expensive O
. O

And O
clearly O
the O
responsibility O
is O
going O
to O
fall O
principally O
on O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
. O

Now O
, O
I O
would O
hope O
that O
sooner O
rather O
than O
later O
we O
could O
see O
a O
civilian O
government O
emerge O
in O
Iraq B-LOC
, O
a O
democratically O
elected O
one O
, O
that O
there O
'd O
be O
more O
cooperation O
from O
the O
international O
community O
, O
on O
both O
the O
peacekeeping O
side O
as O
well O
as O
the O
political O
restructuring O
that O
's O
necessary O
in O
Iraq B-LOC
. O

And O
to O
the O
extent O
we O
can O
move O
that O
along O
more O
quickly O
, O
I O
think O
we O
're O
all O
going O
to O
be O
better O
off O
. O

Being O
the O
sole O
, O
or O
almost O
the O
sole O
power O
there O
, O
both O
in O
terms O
of O
reconstruction O
and O
politically O
, O
exposes O
us O
to O
great O
vulnerabilities O
. O

BLITZER O
Senator O
Lugar O
, O
we O
have O
to O
take O
a O
quick O
break O
, O
but O
before O
we O
do O
, O
I O
wanted O
to O
just O
ask O
you O
, O
the O
U.N B-ORG
. O

role O
-- O
you O
say O
there O
could O
be O
a O
U.N B-ORG
. O

role O
. O

Do O
you O
specifically O
want O
the O
United B-ORG
Nations I-ORG
to O
have O
some O
sort O
of O
peacekeeping O
role O
there O
? O

And O
secondarily O
, O
what O
about O
countries O
like O
France B-LOC
, O
Germany B-LOC
, O
and O
Russia B-LOC
, O
which O
opposed O
the O
Bush O
administration O
's O
war O
plans O
, O
do O
you O
want O
them O
shut O
out O
? O

LUGAR O
No O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
anybody O
shut O
out O
. O

And O
I O
do O
hope O
the O
United B-ORG
Nations I-ORG
will O
play O
a O
vital O
role O
in O
Iraq B-LOC
, O
whether O
it O
be O
in O
peacekeeping O
or O
various O
other O
ways O
, O
and O
I O
hope O
that O
that O
will O
occur O
soon O
. O

I O
think O
we O
really O
need O
an O
internationalization O
of O
the O
process O
, O
for O
the O
very O
reasons O
that O
Senator O
Dodd O
pointed O
out O
. O

BLITZER O
All O
right O

We O
're O
going O
to O
take O
that O
quick O

Stand O

Senators O

more O

then O
they O
there O
goes O
the O

the O
idea O

to O

it O

clearly O
the O
final O

the O
engame O
which O
is O
unfoaling O
right O

i O
think O
it O
's O
very O
significant O
not O
only O
in O
baghdad B-LOC

basra B-LOC
itself O
. O

you O
have O

what O
they O
've O
developed O
here O
, O
wolf O
, O
over O
the O
last O
several O

i O
very O
clear O
and O
increasingly O
clear O
intelligence O
as O
to O
what O
the O
final O
remnants O
of O
the O
regime O
leadership O
are O
in O
terms O
of O
where O
they O
are O
embedded O
in O
the O
cities O

what O
they O
're O
doing O
is O
going O
in O
now O
, O
very O
carefully O
, O
obviously O
some O
symbolic O
raids O
against O
palaces O
. O

but O
the O
more O
important O
presence O
is O
to O
go O
after O
what O
intelligence O
delivers O
and O
that O
's O
where O
these O
key O
leaders O
are O
located O
. O

they O
're O
going O
to O
be O
defended O
fanatically O
but O
intelligence O
is O
so O
crucial O
from O
aerial O
platforms O
and O
special O
ops O
personnel O
to O
give O
the O
three O
assets O
the O
intel O
which O
they O
need O
to O
close O
with O
and O
eliminate O
final O
remnants O
of O
the O
regime O
in O
those O

this O
is O
a O
very O
important O
final O
phase O
here O

it O
looks O
like O
the O
closure O
is O
coming O
here O
now O
more O
rapidly O
than O

as O

talk O

what O
barbara O

was O
reporting O

she O
says O
there O
is O
an O
acknowledgment O

that O
there O
are O
not O
enough O
ground O
troops O
in O

and O
particularly O
in O
baghdad B-LOC

control O
what O
our O
nic O
robertson O
is O
saying O
is O
a O
stage O
of O
anarchy O
in O
some O
parts O
of O
iraq B-LOC
. O

do O
you O
think O
the O
administration O
underestimated O
the O
day O
after O
? O

i O
think O
because O
the O
day O
after O
came O
so O
fast O
and O
so O
suddenly O
in O
way O
. O

i O
think O
that O
there O
's O
been O
a O
pattern O
here O
not O
just O
with O
this O
administration O
, O
but O
over O
the O
last O
ten O
years O
, O
bosnia B-LOC
, O
kosovo B-LOC
, O
afghanistan B-LOC
, O
where O
we O
do O
n't O
quite O
recognize O
when O
the O
old O
order O
collapses O
, O
you O
very O
quickly O
have O
to O
rush O
in O
and O
fill O
it O
with O
some O
kind O
of O
new O
order O
. O

in O
the O
short-term O
, O
that O
's O
going O
to O
have O
to O
mean O
the O
american B-LOC
military O
. O

but O
the O
key O
question O
, O
which O
i O
try O
to O
address O
in O
the O
book O
, O
is O
what O
do O
you O
do O
after O
that O
? O

what O
kind O
of O
authority O
do O
you O
create O
in O
a O
society O
going O
through O
this O
kind O
of O
transition O
. O

and O
how O
do O
you O
know O
that O
the O
local O
iraqi B-LOC
citizens O
will O
make O
up O
this O
government O
or O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
interested O
in O
democracy O
? O

there O
's O
no O
proof O
of O
that O
. O

well O
, O
the O
key O
here O
is O
the O
only O
way O
to O
get O
that O
kind O
of O
legitimate O
government O
to O
have O
it O
look O
good O
is O
to O
hold O
elections O
. O

but O
if O
you O
hold O
elections O
, O
you O
stop O
the O
whole O
process O
of O
building O
a O
rule O
of O
law O
, O
creating O
courts O
, O
creating O
administration O
. O

we O
've O
seen O
in O
the O
past O
in O
bosnia B-LOC
for O
example O
, O
you O
held O
elections O
and O
all O
of O
the O
old O
ethnic O
thugs O
get O
into O
power O
because O
they O
have O
organization O
and O
they O
have O
money O
and O
they O
stop O
the O
process O
of O
genuine O
building O
of O
democracy O
. O

there O
is O
this O
tension O
here O
which O
is O
the O
only O
way O
to O
make O
this O
look O
good O
is O
in O
some O
way O
get O
legitimate O
iraqi B-LOC
authority O
, O
but O
the O
faster O
you O
get O
that O
, O
the O
more O
likely O
you O
stop O
this O
process O
. O

so O
what O
do O
you O
think O
of O
this O
interim O
government O
? O

you O
got O
deputy O
defense O
secretary O
paul O
wolfowitz O
saying O
that O
american B-LOC
and O
british B-LOC
military O
forces O
would O
play O
a O
leading O
role O
in O
setting O
up O
an O
iraqi B-LOC
government O
and O
then O
later O
draw O
civilians O
into O
the O
process O
. O

is O
that O
going O
to O
work O
? O

i O
think O
it O
will O
work O
if O
it O
's O
truly O
broad-based O
and O
truly O
consensual O
, O
try O
and O
include O
all O
different O
people O
and O
including O
them O
in O
creating O
a O

which O
would O
take O

a O

come O
within O

of O

a O
family O
of O

with O
an O

40,000 O
would O
receive O
a O
96 O

instead O
of O
paying O

that O

that O

that O

be O

which O
will O
be O

[ O

and O
this O
plan O
will O
help O
our O
small O

the O
benefits O
of O
the O
growth O
plan O
will O
come O
from O
uncreased O

, O
as O
importantly O
, O
from O
a O
lower O

on O
the O
small O

themselves O
. O

it O
is O
important O
for O
our O
fellow O
citizens O
to O
understand O
that O
most O
small O

pay O
their O
business O
taxes O
at O
the O

most O
small O
businesses O
are O
sole O
proprietorships O
, O

therefore O
, O
when O
you O

you O
benefit O

as O
a O
matter O
of O
fact O
, O
under O
this O
plan O
, O
some O
23 O
million O
small O

owners O
will O
see O
their O
taxes O
cut O

which O
leaves O
more O

more O
money O
for O

, O
more O
money O
for O
job O
creation O
. O

a O
growing O
economy O
also O
needs O
small O
business O
investment O
. O

and O
our O
tax O
code O
should O
encourage O
investment O
. O

today O
a O
small O
business O
can O
deduct O
a O
maximum O
of O
$ O
25,000 O
in O
the O
year O
in O
which O
they O
buy O
equipment O
. O

we O
need O
to O
triple O
the O

that O
can O
be O
deducted O
in O
the O
year O
in O
which O
they O
buy O
equipment O

[ O

so O
i O
propose O
to O

that O
they O
ought O
to O
limit O

limit O
ought O
to O
be O
increased O
to O

and O
that O
limit O
ought O
to O
be O

by O
doing O
so O
, O
we O
promote O
greater O
investment O
in O

and O
when O
a O

bias O
machine O
that O
enhances O
their O

as O
it O

machinery O

is O
likely O
to O
have O
more O

. O

more O
investment O
equals O

and O
what O
we O
are O
interested O
in O
in O
this O
administration O
is O
helping O
people O
who O
look O
for O
work O
find O
a O
job O
. O

[ O
applause O
] O
we O
can O
also O
promote O
economic O
growth O
and O
job O
creation O
by O
removing O
the O
double O
tax O
on O
dividends O
. O

[ O
applause O
] O
taxing O
corporate O
income O
once O
is O
fair O
. O

it O
is O
not O
fair O
for O
the O
federal O
government O
to O
tax O
the O
same O
money O
twice O
. O

the O
burden O
of O
double O
taxation O
falls O
on O
the O
millions O
of O

who O
receive O

falls O
especially O
hard O
on O
seniors O
who O
receive O
half O
of O
all O
dividend O
income O
. O

removal O
of O
double O
taxation O
would O
put O
more O
money O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
investors O
. O

it O
would O
encourage O
more O
investment O
in O
american B-LOC

economists O
say O
that O
this O

will O

our O

and O
since O
half O

the O

will O

now O
, O
these O
measures O
were O
presented O
to O
congress B-ORG
in O
the O
first O

of O
this O

. O

the O
pro O

was O
urgent O
in O

it O
's O
even O

urgent O
today O

[ O

it O
is O

all O

the O

the O

in O

this O
nation O

experienced O
war O

a O
recession O
and O
a O
national O
emergency O
. O

which O
has O
caused O
our O
government O
to O
run O
a O
deficit O
. O

the O
best O
way O
to O
reduce O
the O
deficit O
is O
with O
more O
growth O
in O
our O
economy O
, O
which O
means O
more O

passed O
budget O
resolutions O
that O
show O
real O

. O

and O
now O
the O
congress B-ORG
must O
focus O
on O
a O
robust O
and O
effective O
growth O
package O
. O

we O
need O
at O
least O
$ O
550 O
billion O
in O
that O
package O
because O
the O
more O
tax O
relief O
that O
goes O
to O
the O

we O
will O

well O
, O
lou O
, O
one O
thing O
that O
the O
coroner O
has O
been O
able O
to O
determine O
is O
that O
the O
skeletal O

are O
those O

two O
, O
the O
remains O
of O
the O
almost O
full-term O
baby O

. O

and O
of O
course O
, O
this O
is O
significant O
because O
laci O
peterson O
, O
when O
she O
disappeared O
from O
her O
modesto B-LOC
home O
, O
was O
7 O
1/2 O

that O
was O

at O

that O
he O
was O

now O
, O
in O
a O
strange O
twist O
in O
all O
of O
this O
, O
just O
yesterday O
separate O
from O
the O
skeletal O
remains O
i O
alluded O
to O
earlier O
a O
man O
hiking O
near O
the O
berkeley B-LOC
marina I-LOC
found O
a O
bone O
, O
and O
they O
are O
now O
looking O
at O
that O
as O
another O
possible O
lead O
in O
this O
case O
. O

this O
person O
came O
across O
the O
bone O
at O
the O
shore O
. O

he O
brought O
it O
home O
and O
contacted O
the O
authorities O
, O
and O
we O
took O
possession O
of O
it O
. O

and O
you O
're O
trying O
to O
connect O
it O
to O
the O
other O
-- O
well O
, O
we O
're O
trying O
to O
find O
out O
if O
it O
's O
a O
human O
bone O
and O
whether O
or O
not O
it O
is O
related O
to O
the O
others O
. O

reporter O
: O
and O
yet O
another O
reason O
why O
that O
bone O
could O
be O
a O
key O
link O
, O
there O
are O
reports O
that O
have O
surfaced O
that O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
female O
remains O
that O
were O
found O
the O
skeleton O
was O
not O
completely O
intact O
. O

now O
this O
case O
is O
also O
taking O
on O
a O
rather O
, O
we O
should O
say O
, O
almost O
a O
tv O
episodic O
forensic O
pathology O
angle O
because O
they O
're O
going O
to O
bring O
in O
an O
expert O
on O
what O
's O
called O
alufating O
decay O
, O
and O
basically O
this O
person O
is O
going O
to O
come O
in O
here O
and O
look O
at O
the O
body O
. O

this O
is O
in O
the O
damage O
aspect O
of O
it O
. O

and O
they O
say O
these O
experts O
will O
be O
able O
to O
tell O
how O
long O
the O
body O
had O
been O
in O
there O
and O
if O
the O
remains O
of O
the O
almost O
full-term O
baby O
boy O
were O
inside O
the O
female O
's O
remains O
at O
the O
time O
of O
death O
. O

also O
, O
the O
coroner O
could O
know O
right O
now O
but O
is O
not O
saying O
if O
there O
was O
some O
sort O
of O
trauma O
to O
either O
of O
these O
skeletons O
, O
for O
example O
, O
if O
they O
could O
see O
the O
bone O
compromised O
in O
some O
way O
they O
could O
tell O
if O
there O
had O
been O
a O
stab O
or O
a O
shooting O
. O

we O
may O
learn O
a O
lot O
more O
on O
this O
in O
just O
15 O
minutes O
. O

that O
's O
because O
modesto B-LOC

have O
scheduled O
a O

while O
they O
may O
not O

me O

you O
, O
if O
i O
may O
, O
quickly O
, O
are O
we O
expecting O
-- O
is O
there O
any O
reason O
for O
us O
to O
expect O
that O
there O
would O
be O
the O
ability O
to O
identify O
those O
remains O
as O
a O
result O
of O
these O
autopsies O
this O
afternoon O

reporter O
: O
it O
sounds O
like O
all O
of O
this O
will O
be O
too O
quick O
, O
and O
it O
seems O
underlying O
all O
this O
is O
there O
could O
be O
an O
absence O
of O
dental O
records O
. O

that O
's O
particularly O
important O
for O
the O
adult O
female O
remains O
. O

so O
now O
they O
're O
going O
to O
have O
to O
turn O
to O
dna O
, O
and O
that O
's O
why O
they O
're O
calling O
in O
these O
experts O
. O

some O
dna O
testing O
can O
be O
very O
quick O
, O
but O
sometimes O
it O
can O
take O
up O

weeks O

even O
more O

any O

a O

he O
's O
at O
least O
-- O
hedging O
his O
bets O
by O
keeping O
40 O

but O
basically O
he's O
decided O
that O
the O

not O

wait O
he O

it O

bailing O

a O

obviously O
by O

my O
point O
about O
this O
, O
if O
ted O

were O
so O
smart O
and O
he O
's O
a O
very O
smart O
guy O
but O
he O
did O
not O
sell O
at O
the O
top O
, O
okay O
? O

he O
did O
n't O
sell O
at O
$ O
60 O
. O

hind O
sight O
would O
have O
like O
to O
have O
gotten O
that O
. O

he O
believed O
in O
the O

like O
most O
other O
people O
did O
. O

we'll O
look O
back O
five O
years O
from O
now O
, O
you O
can O
see O
, O
he O
has O
lost O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
. O

you O
know O
, O
he O
still O
had O
$ O
1.7 O
billion O
, O
we're O
not O
shedding O
tears O
. O

he O
did O
have O
$ O
8 O

. O

he O
's O
left O
a O
lot O
on O
the O
table O
. O

we O
'll O
look O
back O
five O
years O
from O
now O
and O
say O
, O
when O
the O

is O
either O
at O

still O
or O
$ O
8 O
or O
$ O

say O
, O
he O
was O
either O
very O
smart O
or O
not O
smart O
at O
all O
. O

he O
's O
still O
hedging O
his O

the O

the O

i O

long O

i O
was O
in O

really O
all O

about O

the O

for O

the O
drive O
for O

, O
all O
that O
propaganda O
, O
was O
essentially O
nonsensical O
because O
in O
1990 O
, O
saddam O
hussein O
made O
the O
only O
self O
criticism O
. O

he O
said O
, O
i O
could O
either O
invade O
kuwait B-LOC

finish O
developing O
the O

maybe O
before O
the O

then O

he O
said O
, O
oh O
, O
i O
should O
have O
got O
the O
nuclear O
weapon O
before O
i O
invaded O
. O

he O
was O
right O
about O
that O
. O

but O
that O
means O
that O
he O
inaugurated O
at O
that O
point O
like O
a O
dozen-year O

war O
where O
the O

could O
be O
criticized O
for O
doing O
too O
little O

all O
we O

now O
a O

of O

taking O

as O
to O
why O
she O
stepped O
down O

the O

she O

watched O

the O

that O
she O

in O
the O
first O

or O
did O
n't O
leave O

she O

quite O

misfit O
for O
this O

she O
showed O
that O
over O

she O
was O
not O
good O
at O
all O
at O
communicating O
the O

the O

certainly O
to O
the O

she O
was O
even O
worse O
at O
bringing O
the O
epa B-ORG

, O
the O
epa B-ORG
environmental O
policy O

' O
message O
to O
this O

because O
she O
saw O
herself O
undercut O
over O

over O

that O
's O
interesting O
because O
leading O
into O
it O
, O
while O
she O
was O
new B-LOC

she O
sued O
the O
epa B-ORG

she O
was O
very O
much O
considering O
herself O

and O
then O
only O
to O
end O
up O
becoming O
the O
head O
of O

there O
was O

let O
's O
talk O
a O
little O
bit O
more O
about O
what O
the O
navy O
does O
to O
prevent O
such O
tragedies O
. O

we O
were O
talking O
about O
it O
this O
morning O
and O
we O
put O
together O
some O
graphics O
for O
you O
. O

i O
'll O
try O
to O
explain O
it O
the O
best O
i O
can O
from O
what O
i O
remember O
from O
being O
on O
the O
`` O
uss O
abraham O
lincoln O
'' O
this O
is O
an O
amphibious O
ship O
, O
rather O
, O
but O
this O
is O
what O
the O
navy O
does O
with O
regard O
to O
prevention O
. O

everybody O
that O
is O
, O
every O
sailor O
that's O
entersing O
the O
navy O
does O
take O
a O
swim O
test O
. O

they O
learn O
how O
to O
tread O
water O
and O
do O
the O
dead O
man O
float O
and O
they O
have O
to O
pass O
that O
in O
order O
to O
continue O
on O
. O

also O
drills O
take O
place O
before O
sailors O
get O
on O
to O
any O
ship O
, O
before O
any O
deployment O
, O
usually O
twice O
a O
day O
, O
they O
're O
practicing O
man O
overboard O
drills O
, O
knowing O
where O
to O
go O
, O
where O
to O
report O
to O
if O
indeed O
a O
man O
overboard O
takes O
place O
and O
as O
the O
deployment O
begins O
, O
those O
wane O
off O
, O
but O
they O
know O
where O
to O
go O
quickly O
. O

they O
also O
wear O
float O
coats O
. O

you O
can O
see O
them O
here O
. O

the O
yellow O
shirt O
is O
wearing O
a O
yellow O
float O
coat O
. O

everything O
is O
color O
coordinated O
. O

you O
see O
the O
gentleman O
here O
wearing O
a O
brown O
one O
and O
they O
have O
toggles O
to O
pull O
and O
inflate O
. O

they O
also O
have O
a O
manual O
device O
so O
if O
the O
toggles O
do O
n't O
work O
they O
can O
blow O
air O
into O
the O
inflation O
device O
. O

they O
have O
dive O
goggles O
and O
they O
're O
able O
to O
find O
them O
. O

it O
also O
has O
a O
strobe O
light O
and O
a O
whistle O
. O

also O
such O
location O
devices O
, O
some O
ship O
have O
smoke O
floats O
they O
can O
toss O
out O
so O
the O
man O
overboard O
will O
be O
able O
to O
use O
smoke O
signals O
as O
a O
way O
of O
trying O
to O
find O
or O
locate O
, O
let O
the O
rescuer O
locate O
them O
. O

also O
24/7 O
there O
are O
individuals O
on O
watch O
. O

all O
throughout O
the O
ship O
, O
all O
around O
the O
ship O
. O

and O
indeed O
, O
there O
is O
netting O
on O
most O
parts O
of O
the O
ship O
, O
not O
on O
entire O
all O
around O
the O
entire O
ship O
, O
but O
on O
most O
parts O
there O
is O
a O
very O
thick O
netting O
. O

now O
let O
's O
talk O
about O
the O
man O
overboard O
rescue O
and O
when O
indeed O
there O
is O
a O
man O
overboard O
situation O
. O

you O
will O
hear O
a O
p.a O
. O

announcement O
around O
the O
entire O
ship O
. O

there O
is O
a O
man O
overboard O
so O
everyone O
knows O
they O
have O
to O
react O
quickly O
. O

a O
ship-wide O
search O
will O
happen O
f. O
they O
do O
n't O
see O
that O
person O
go O
overboard O
, O
but O
if O
indeed O
they O
do O
see O
someone O
go O
overboard O
, O
the O
ship O
starts O
to O
circle O
that O
area O
continuously O
. O

also O
small O
boats O
sometimes O
go O
out O
into O
the O
water O
, O
but O
even O
more O
importantly O
, O
helicopters O
are O
launched O
immediately O
. O

inside O
those O
helicopters O
rescue O
imswimmers O
. O

if O
indeed O
the O
man O
overboard O
is O
located O
, O
well O
the O
hoister O
is O
dropped O
down O
with O
usually O
a O
torso O
harness O
. O

if O
the O
man O
overboard O
is O
injured O
then O
they O
may O
use O
a O
basket O
, O
but O
more O
than O
likely O
those O
swimmers O
will O
go O
right O
into O
the O
water O
and O
try O
and O
help O
the O
swimmer O
hook O
up O
on O
that O
harness O
and O
pull O
them O
up O
into O
the O
helo O
and O
pull O
them O
back O
on O
to O
the O
ship O
for O
treatment O
and O
usually O
a O
search O
takes O
about O
24 O
hours O
. O

the O
search O
crews O
will O
go O
24 O
hours O
before O
calling O
off O
that O
search O
. O

why O
call O
it O
off O
? O

there O
's O
a O
number O
of O
reasons O
to O
look O
at O
. O

depending O
on O
the O
water O
temperature O
, O
it O
's O
very O
possible O
that O
or O
very O
common O
in O
cold O
water O
that O
someone O
will O
not O
survive O
a O
certain O
amount O
of O
time O
. O

also O
the O
reason O
for O
the O
24-hour O
search O
is O
they O
fail O
they O
've O
exhausted O
all O
resources O
by O
that O
time O
. O

anyway O
, O
we O
'll O

what O

five O
motions O
are O
being O
heard O
today O
in O
the O
case O
of O
lee O
boyd O
malvo O
, O
the O
teenage O
sniper O
suspect O
. O

one O
for O
a O
change O
of O
venue O
. O

defense O
attorneys O
argue O
that O
there O
has O
been O
so O
much O
pretrial O
publicity O
, O
including O
an O
alleged O
confession O
from O
malvo O
, O
that O
this O
has O
tainted O
the O
jury O
pool O
. O

their O
more O
intriguing O
argument O
is O
that O
one O
of O
the O
charges O
against O
malvo O
is O
under O
virginia B-LOC
's O
anti-terrorism O
statute O
and O
they O
argue O
that O
every O

potentially O
a O
member O
of O
the O
victim O

class O

and O
therefore O
, O
disqualified O
from O

as O
a O
juror O

the O

will O
argue O
against O
this O
motion O

he O
calls O
it O
factually O
pro O
pos O

. O

if O
history O
is O

guide O

this O
motion O

have O
a O
tough O
time O

no O
case O
has O
been O
moved O
out O
of O
fairfax B-LOC
county I-LOC
since O

there O
also O
is O
a O
motion O
to O
dismiss O
this O
case O
. O

defense O
attorneys O
argue O
that O
an O
individual O
can O
not O
be O
charged O
under O
federal O
law O
and O
then O
state O
law O
for O
the O
same O
act O

prosecutors O

argue O
against O
the O
motion O

sosa O

by O
a O

that O
happened O
to O

in O

those O
three O
men O
did O
n't O
realize O
how O
lucky O
they O
were O
until O
they O
were O
plucked O
out O
of O

what O

it O
you O
were O
looking O
at O
when O
you O
looked O
out O
over O

? O

well O
, O
it O
was O
quite O
windy O
, O
gusty O
winds O
up O
to O
40 O
, O
50 O
miles O
an O
hour O
. O

and O
it O
came O
from O
southeast O
. O

and O
we O
got O
the O
alarm O
this O
distress O
situation O
just O
before O
5:00 O
in O
the O
morning O
. O

and O
we O
were O
on O
relatively O
slow O
speed O
for O
the O
time O
being O
, O
but O
we O
of O
course O
, O
speeded O
up O
to O
the O
position O
, O
which O
was O
given O
, O
and O
we O
-- O
after O
an O
hour O
, O
we O
spotted O
the O
fishing O
boat O
in O
the O
waters O
. O

these O
men O
were O
in O
some O
water O
that O
was O
quite O
frigid O
. O

if O
they O
stayed O
out O
there O
for O
long O
they O
could O
have O
suffered O
severe O
tragedy O
, O
perhaps O
. O

i O
want O
to O
ask O
you O
, O
have O
you O
ever O
done O
anything O
like O
this O
? O

have O
you O
ever O
seen O
anything O
like O
this O
done O
? O

no O
, O
i O
have O
never O
seen O
this O
type O
of O
operation O
where O
you O
have O
a O
fishing O
vessel O
disappear O
, O
more O
or O
less O
. O

and O
that O
the O
survivors O
, O
they O
had O
to O
go O
into O
the O
water O
, O
pick O
them O
up O
from O
the O
water O
. O

was O
there O
any O
point O
at O
which O
you O
did O
n't O
think O
you O
would O
be O
able O
to O
pull O
it O
off O
? O

sorry O
, O
please O
say O
again O
? O

was O
there O
any O
point O
at O
which O
you O
thought O
you O
would O
n't O
be O
able O
to O
pull O
it O
off O
? O

no O
, O
absolutely O
not O
. O

we O
-- O
we O
were O
100 O
% O
sure O
we O
could O
make O
it O
, O
absolutely O
. O

because O
we O
came O
very O
close O
to O
the O
vessel O
. O

we O
had O
our O
rescue O
boat O
out O
soon O
. O

so O
i O
felt O
confident O
about O
it O
. O

i O
saw O
the O
fishermen O
also O
had O
the O
surviving O
suits O
on O
. O

so O
that O
gave O
me O
more O
time O
to O
help O
. O

that O
was O
a O
good O
thing O
for O
them O
. O

what O
about O
your O
crew O
that O
was O
actually O
involved O
in O
the O
rescue O
here O
? O

are O
they O
trained O
for O
this O
sort O
of O
thing O
? O

yes O
, O
they O
are O
very O
much O
well-trained O
. O

we O
train O
for O
this O
type O
of O
operation O
at O
least O
every O
14 O
days O
. O

i O
'm O
hopeful O
those O
three O
fishermen O
bought O
you O
a O
glass O
of O
wine O
once O
you O
got O
them O
on O

. O

we O
gave O
them O
some O

these O
incredible O

i O
'm O
not O
sure O
if O
you O

able O

we O

this O
month O
sending O

ashters O
to O

the O
red B-LOC
planet I-LOC

one O
of O
the O
big O
questions O
about O
mars B-LOC
is O
when O
or O
whether O
humans O
will O
ever O
be O
able O
to O
visit O
. O

it O
's O
an O
idea O
plagued O
with O
unsolved O
problems O
. O

the O
latest O
issue O
of O
'' O
popular O
science O

takes O
a O
look O
at O
the O
challenges O
nasa B-ORG

good O
to O
see O
you O
, O
jeff O

thank O
you O
. O

it O
was O
only O
about O
30 O
years O
ago O
when O
we O
went O
to O
the O
moon O
. O

so O
what O
's O
the O
difficulty O
in O
being O
able O
to O
go O
to O
mars B-LOC
? O

it O
's O
unimaginably O
difficult O
and O
different O
. O

mars B-LOC
is O
at O
most O
times O
100 O
million O
miles O
away O
from O
us O
. O

it O
's O
a O
nine-month O
trip O
. O

then O
if O
we O
stay O
there O
for O
about O
a O
year O
or O
two O
, O
the O
whole O
trip O
could O
last O
about O
three O
years O
. O

we O
're O
talking O
about O
conditions O
where O
there O
's O
radiation O
in O
space O
cosmic O
radiation O
that O
could O
cause O
cancer O
. O

the O
communications O
conditions O
once O
you O
're O
on O
mars B-LOC
, O
just O
to O
talk O
to O
people O
on O
earth B-LOC
, O
there O
's O
a O
20 O
minute O
delay O
in O
the O
conversation O
. O

so O
the O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
the O
issues O
are O
so O
much O
larger O
than O
going O
to O
the O
moon O
. O

and O
for O
now O
, O
it O
's O
250 O
days O
, O
which O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
maximum O
for O
astronauts O
in O
space O
anyway O
. O

but O
as O
you O
say O
, O
it O
's O
a O
much O
further O
travel O
. O

but O
let O
's O
talk O
about O
some O
of O
the O
hurdles O
that O
hamper O
humans O
to O
be O
able O
to O
survive O
there O
. O

the O
dust O
, O
for O
one O
thing O
. O

cataracts O
another O
. O

let O
's O
talk O
about O
the O
right O
kind O
of O
spacecraft O
that O
would O
be O
able O
to O
allow O
humans O
to O
actually O
get O
that O
far O
and O
to O
survive O
. O

right O
. O

well O
, O
first O
of O
all O
, O
the O
spacecraft O
would O
not O
be O
launched O
from O
earth B-LOC
. O

you O
'd O
have O
to O
launch O
is O
from O
in O
space O
already O
, O
which O
means O
we O
would O
have O
to O
build O
it O
in O
space O
. O

so O
that O
means O
we O
need O
a O
good O
shuttle O
that O
's O
going O
to O
take O
us O
back O
and O
forth O
to O
build O
the O
spacecraft O
. O

then O
we O
have O
to O
come O
up O
with O
the O
fuel O
that O
will O
take O
it O
out O
of O
the O
earth's B-LOC
orbit O
all O
the O
way O
to O
mars B-LOC
. O

that O
's O
probably O
going O
to O
be O
nuclear O
propulsion O
at O
this O
point O
again O
something O
we O
haven't O
really O
developed O
yet O
, O
because O
we O
could O
n't O
carry O
that O
much O
fuel O
, O
obviously O
. O

liquid O
oxygen O
would O
be O
way O
too O
heavy O
to O
carry O
all O
the O
way O
to O
mars B-LOC
. O

the O
bigger O
issue O
is O
once O
we O
get O
there O
, O
we O
ca O
n't O
carry O
oxygen O
or O
water O
or O
food O
to O
stay O
there O
three O
years O
, O
so O
we O
're O
going O
to O
have O
to O
do O
all O
of O
that O
on O
the O
surface O
of O
the O
planet O
. O

and O
think O
of O
it O
. O

mars B-LOC
is O
carbon O
dioxide O
. O

so O
we O
ca O
n't O
breathe O
there O
. O

so O
we O
're O
going O
to O
have O
to O
come O
up O
with O
some O
conversion O
technique O
to O
create O
water O
, O
to O
create O
oxygen O
and O
then O
some O
way O
of O
growing O
food O
on O
the O
planet O
itself O
. O

all O
of O
this O
is O
in O
the O
works O
now O
, O
but O
i O
think O
it O
's O
going O
to O
take O
quite O
a O
few O
years O
to O
develop O
it O
. O

you O
talk O
about O
the O
cosmic O
radiation O
. O

then O
of O
course O
there O
is O
the O
zero O
g O
bone O
loss O
, O
almost O
like O
the O
eroding O
of O
bone O
to O
humans O
that O
would O
be O
at O
risk O
as O
well O
. O

absolutely O
. O

there O
could O
be O
as O
much O
as O
50 O
% O
bone O
loss O
in O
astronauts O
in O
mars B-LOC
. O

why O
? O

during O
the O
time O
in O
mars B-LOC
. O

because O
when O
the O
body O
has O
-- O
when O
there O
is O
no O
dpravity O
as O
there O
is O
on O
mars B-LOC
, O
the O
body O
doesn't O
pick O
up O
the O
calcium O
in O
the O
bones O
, O
so O
it O
does O
n't O
keep O
getting O
the O
bones O
stronger O
and O
stronger O
. O

so O
they O
will O
just O
lose O
it O
. O

they O
will O
be O
almost O
like O
old O
people O
even O
at O
the O
age O
of O
40. O

Hey O

who O
do O
you O
think O
should O
run O

Sara O
uh O
-- O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

I O
was O
going O
to O
say O
, O
that O
's O
quite O
the O
topic O
. O

um O
-- O
I O
have O
n't O
thought O
about O
it O
much O
. O

I O
know O
my O
husband O
said O
he O
thinks O
-- O
that O
uh O
-- O
Colin O
Powell O
should O
-- O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
he O
will O
. O

Suzanne O
I O
I O
do O
n't O
he O
think O
will O
either O
, O
because O
he O
turned O
it O
down O
in O
two O
thousand O

four O

Sara O
Right O
, O
and O
Suzanne O
Sorry O
, O
two O

two O
thousand O

Sara O
Two O
thousand O
, O
yeah O
, O
the O
one O
before O
that O
. O

Suzanne O
Yeah O
. O

Sara O
Yeah O
. O

uh O
-- O
I O
'm O
not O
very O
fond O
of O
Hillary O
Clinton O
, O
so O
I O
-- O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
I O
'd O
go O
for O
her O
, O
but O
-- O
but O
uh O
what O
do O
you O
think O
? O

Suzanne O
um O
-- O
I O
am O
reluctant O
to O
see O
another O
Bush O
brother O
on O
the O
ticket O
for O
the O
Republicans B-ORG
Sara O
Mhm O
. O

Suzanne O
but O
I O
think O
that O
putting O
Jeb O
Bush O
would O
make O
h- O
-- O
the O
Republican B-ORG
ticket O
easier O
to O
defeat O
. O

Sara O
Mhm O
. O

Suzanne O
um O
-- O
I O
really O
do O
n't O
think O
that O
Hillary O
Clinton O
-- O
would O
be O
-- O
a O
good O
choice O
for O
the O
Democrats B-ORG
. O

Sara O
Yeah O
. O

Suzanne O
um O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
Barak O
Obama O
would O
be O
a O
very O
good O
choice O
for O
the O
Democrats B-ORG
. O

Sara O
Uh-huh O
. O

Suzanne O
Just O
because O
he O
's O
-- O
he O
's O
really O
young O
, O
and O
he O
's O
going O
to O
be O
starting O
off O
his O
career O
. O

Sara O
Uh-huh O
. O

Suzanne O
um O
I O
would O
almost O
like O
to O
see O
John O
Edwards O
on O
the O

again O
. O

Sara O
Uh-huh O
. O

Yeah O
. O

uh O
Yeah O
. O

Did O
they O
ever O
do O
that O
one O
? O

That O
's O
n- O
the- O
that O
's O
happened O
before O
, O
has O
n't O
it O
, O
where O
someone O
who O
-- O
who O
was O
defeated O
ran O
again O
? O

Suzanne O
Yeah O
. O

Sara O
They O
do O
n't O
do O
it O
very O
often O
, O
probably O
just O
because O
they O
figure O
if O
he O
lost O
once O
, O
he'll O
Suzanne O
Well O
I O
I O
think O
he O
's O
a O
really O
good O
candidate O
, O
and O
four O
more O
years O
could O
really O
help O
him O
develop O
his O
um O
-- O
could O
help O
him O
develop O
-- O
hi- O
his O
voting O
record O
especially O
. O

Sara O
Right O
. O

Suzanne O
And O
I O
think O
that O
would O
help O
the O
Democratic B-ORG

a O
lot O
. O

Sara O
Right O
, O
because O
that O
's O
something O
he O
got O

kind O
of O
-- O
uh O
-- O
got O
brought O
up O
a O
lot O
. O

Suzanne O
Yeah O
. O

Sara O
Hm O
. O

Well O
, O
they O
-- O
let O
's O
see O
. O

Suzanne O
I O
mean O
, O
I O
'd O
like O
to O
s- O
-- O
I O
'd O
like O
to O
see O
the O
Greens B-ORG
run O
David O
Cobb O

Sara O
Uh-huh O
. O

uh O
See O
, O
hav- O
I O
have O
n't O
paid O
much O
attention O
to O
them O
, O
I O
-- O
I O
kind O
of O
looked O
at O
the O
-- O
the O
other O
listed O
candidates O
-- O
but O
I O
figure O
-- O
they O
d- O
-- O
they O
d- O
none O
of O
them O
had O
enough O
support O
to O
get O
close O
, O
so O
Suzanne O

Sara O
um O
-- O
trying O
to O
think O
who O
else O
-- O
Arnold O
Schwarzenegger O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
-- O
well O
he O
's O
not O
qualified O
anyway O
, O
but O
Suzanne O
Well O
, O
they O
might O
change O
something O
, O
you O
know O

between O
now O

Sara O
I O
've O
heard O
people O
say O
that O
would O
take O

I O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
they O
will O
. O

uh O
That O
takes O
a O
Constitutional O
amendment O

That O
's O
pretty O
hard O
to O
-- O
to O
get O
through O

A O
Right O

A O
I O
only O
heard O

You O
know O
, O
he O
was O
articulate O
, O

guy O
could O
be O
president O

And O

those O
four O
years O
later O
-- O
uh O
, O
eight O
years O
later O
, O
whatever O
it O
was O
. O

Because O
it O
was O
a O
long O
time O
later O
. O

B O
Sure O
. O

A O
I O
saw O
him O
, O
and O
I O
was O
telling O
all O
my O
friends O
, O
oh O
, O

for O
vote O
for O
this O
guy O
, O
Bill O

They O
were O
saying O
, O
oh O

, O
that O
old O
country O
-- O
dump O
. O

He O
do O
n't O
know O
nothing O
. O

I O
said O
, O
he O
's O
a O
Rhodes O
scholar O
, O
he O
's O
smart O
. O

He O
's O
and O
he O
's O
funny O
and O
he O
's O
good O
. O

Oh O
no O
, O
no O
, O
he O
's O
too O
young O
, O
and O
he O
came O
from O
that O
little O
, O
little O
podunk O
-- O
g- O
uh O
state O
he O
never O
did O
anything O
. O

I O
said O
, O
he O
's O
going O
to O
be O
President O
. O

I O
was O
telling O
all O
my O
friends O
. O

I O
said O
, O
you O
know O
, O
and O
I O
was O
before O
-- O
they O
said O
, O
well O
, O
I O
thought O
you O
supported O
George O
Bush O
, O
and O
I O
said O
, O
well O
I O
did O
support O
George O
Bush O
, O
but O
he O
does O
n't O
know O
what O
he O
's O
doing O
and O
he O
needs O
to O
go O
. O

And O
uh O
so O
I O
says O
vote O
for O
him O
, O
vote O
for O
him O
, O
vote O
for O
him O
, O
you O
know O
. O

And O
they O
voted O
for O
Jerry O
Brown O
and O
all O
these O
crazy O
people O
. O

B O
Yeah O
, O
that O
's O
right O
. O

Oh O
, O
is O
that O
right O
? O

A O
And O
I O
says O
, O
you O
're O
just O
wasting O
your O
vote O
, O
why O
are O
you O
doing O
that O
? O

He O
needs O
your O
help O
. O

So O
I O
went O
and O
volunteered O
for O
him O
and O
everything O
, O
and O
-- O
and O
I O
met O
Hillary O
, O
and O
and O
Tipper O
and O
Al O
, O
and O
and O
I O
almost O
got O
to O
meet O
him O
. O

B O
Oh O
, O
is O
that O
right O
? O

Really O
? O

A O
Uh-huh O
. O

I O
worked O
at O
the O
Democrats O
Convention O
and O
everything O
. O

Uh-huh O
, O
yeah O
. O

B O
Very O
cool O
, O
very O
cool O
. O

A O
And O
uh O
it O
was O
great O
, O
I O
had O
a O
good O
time O
, O
and O
they O
B O
What O
great O
experience O
. O

A O
Yeah O
, O
and O
they O
fed O
us O
, O
and O
had O
a O
party O
for O
us O
, O
all O
that O
kind O
of O
stuff O
, O
you O
know O
. O

So O
it O
was O
fun O
. O

But O
it O
worked O
out O
. O

But O
I O
think O
we O
they O
better O
go O
back O
to O
a O
governor O
from O
like O
uh O
B O
Well O
, O
sure O
. O

A O
uh O
North B-LOC
Carolina I-LOC
, O
or O
like O
the O
one O
from O
Kansas B-LOC
. O

She O
's O
very O
tall O
, O
she O
reminds O
you O
of O
uh O
Christie O
Whitman O
, O
the O
governor O
of O
New B-LOC
Jersey I-LOC
, O
remember O
her O
? O

B O
Yep O

Okay O

A O
She O
's O
tall O
, O
kind O

She O

uh O
you O

Real O
smart O

quiet-spoked O

stern O
, O
you O

B O
Yeah O
, O
not O
not O
real O
feminine O
, O
yeah O
. O

Eh O

A O
And O
so O
I O

she O
she O
can O
give O
that O
demeanor O
that O
people O
like O
in O

, O
of O
being O
the O

Well O
, O

want O

They O
want O
to O

that O
they O
're O
trustworthy O

honorable O
, O
and O
I O
think O
, O
you O
know O
A O

Yeah O
, O
but O
B O
Clinton O
did O
so O
many O
fantastic O
things O
during O
his O

, O
but O
he O
shot O
himself O
on O
the O

with O
all O
of O
his O
personal O
garbage O
, O
you O

and O
I O

that O
kind O
of O
a O
-- O
oh O

a O
long O
time O
ago O

and O
we O
just O
c- O
oh O
, O
all O
that O
money O
, O
for O
just O
about O
bankrupting O

. O

That O
is O
crazy O
. O

I O
think O
that O

in O
ninety O
seven O
or O
eight O
A O
Yeah O
. O

B O
I O
think O
we O
merged O
in O
ninety-eight O
. O

So O
, O
yeah O
, O
Bank B-ORG
of O
America's B-ORG
everywhere O
. O

And O
um O
-- O
Mm O
-- O
Gosh O
I O
ca O
n't O
think O
of O
anything O
else O
to O
say O
about O
them O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

They O
're O
all O
right O
. O

They O
have O
good O
benefits O
. O

A O
Yeah O
. O

B O
Not O
good O
pay O
. O

A O
Yeah O
. O

Yeah O
I O
I O
'm O
not O
really O
familiar O
with O
the O
working O
world O
that O
much O
. O

So O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
with O
my O
part-time O
job O
, O
it O
's O
a O
lot O
it O
's O
really O
good O
for O
a O
student O
, O
because O
I O
only O
work O
uh O
two O
hours O
a O
night O
. O

B O
Oh O
that O
's O
good O
. O

A O
So O
, O
yeah O
, O
and O
then O
it O
's O
pretty O
flexible O
. O

Like O
uh O
-- O
uh O
I O
'm O
pretty O
busy O
with O
other O
, O
you O
know O
-- O
student O
organizations O
, O
and O
hanging O
out O
with O
friends O
and O
stuff O
, O
so O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
work O
on O
the O
weekends O
, O
and O
then O
I O
can O
take O
off O
sometimes O
. O

So O
. O

B O
Yeah O
. O

That O
's O
good O
. O

A O
So O
a O
pretty O
good O
deal O
, O
and O
the O
cool O
thing O
about O
is O
like O
-- O
everybody O
at O
work O
is O
really O
friendly O
, O
B O
Yeah O
, O
that O
's O
good O
. O

A O
and O
uh O
I O
think O
really O
that O
what O
brings O
that O
on O
is O
our O
boss O
. O

Like O
he's O
just O
a O
really O
nice O
guy O
, O
and O
-- O
he O
's O
pretty O
laid O
back O
. O

So O
. O

B O
That O
comes O
in O
handy O
. O

A O
Yeah O
. O

B O
Got O
to O
have O
a O
good O
boss O
. O

A O
Yeah O
. O

B O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
there O
's O
any O
pudding O
in O
the O
refrigerator O
honey O
. O

You O
got O
to O
go O
-- O
I O
I O
think O

ate O
it O
all O
, O
but O
go O
look O
around O
-- O
I O
know O
there's O
still O
some O
more O
um O
Trix O
yogurt O
. O

And O
I O
'll O
buy O

Friday O
. O

He's O
all O
upset O
with O
me O
cause O
there O
's O
no O
pudding O
. O

Yeah O
, O
I O
've O
had O
many O
many O
different O
kinds O
of O
managers O
, O
and O
when O
they O
're O
laid O
back O
do O
n't O
micro- O
manage O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
you O
definitely O
, O
work O
harder O
for O
them O
, O
and O
do O
a O
better O
job O
and O
A O
Yeah O
. O

Did O
you O
ever O
see O
the O
uh O
movie O
Office O
Space O
? O

B O
yes O
, O
I O
did O
. O

A O
Yeah O
. O

B O
Yes O
I O
did O
. O

It O
took O
me O
a O
second O
, O
but O
I O
sure O
did O
. O

A O
Yeah O
. O

I O
always O
think O
about O
that O
like O
-- O
or O
a O
lot O
of O
I O
think O
college O
students O
think O
about O
that O
like O
with O
some O
office O
jobs O
, O
you O
know O
? O

B O
Yeah O
. O

It O
's O
uh O
A O
So O
. O

It O
's O
kind O
of O
like O
, O
that O
's O
the O
job O
that O
they O
're O
t- O
everyone's O
trying O
to O
stay O
away O
from O
. O

B O
Yeah O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
they O
're O
quite O
-- O
They O
they O
've O
gotten O
better O
. O

I O
know O
the O
bigger O
companies O
have O
tried O
to O
-- O
stay O
away O
from O
that O
, O
cause O
uh O
-- O
The O
the O
that O
does O
wear O
you O
out O
. O

I O
remember O
Bank B-ORG
of O
America B-ORG
was O
-- O
kind O
of O
like O
that O
in O
the O
department O
I O
used O
to O
work O
in O
, O
years O
and O
years O
ago O
. O

A O
Uh-huh O
. O

B O
Oh O
my O
God O
. O

Boring O
looking O
walls O
, O
boring O
people O
, O
boring O
job O
. O

A O
Yeah O

B O
It O
it O
drained O
the O
life O
out O
of O
you O
whenever O
we O
had O
to O
go O
to O
work O
. O

It O
just O
-- O
sucked O
. O

A O
Yeah O
. O

B O
But O
they O
tried O
to O
make O
it O
more O
entertaining O
. O

I O
think O
more O
companies O
are O
going O
for O
the O
uh O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
employee O
satisfaction O
. O

Finally O
. O

Th- O
that O

the O
Bank O

ninety O
percent O
associate O
satisfaction O
. O

And O
they O
were O
all O
happy O
when O
they O
finally O
got O
there O
. O

But O
we O
did O
n't O
get O
anything O
for O
it O
. O

They O
did O
n't O
like O
give O
everybody O
bonuses O
or O
anything O
. O

Sheesh O

They O
because O
they O
got O
some O
better O
insurance O
policies O
and O
some O
better O

bonuses O

paid O

at O
the O
end O

little O
over O
three O
hundred O

onli- O
I O
do O
online O
, O
you O
know O
, O
online O
, O
uh O
, O
pharmaceutical O
company O
-- O
where O
I O
have O
-- O
filled O
and O
-- O
refilled O
take O
orders O
sent O
back O
to O
us O
online O
. O

Bill O
Oh O
, O
okay O
. O

That O
's O
interesting O
. O

Alexander O
And O
, O
you O
know O
, O
and O
I O
have O
a O
company O
, O
as O
well O
, O
set O
up O
. O

I O
think O
we O
have O
the O
account O
manager O
, O
and O
we O
have O
-- O
the O
vice O
president O
. O

We O
have O
super- O
team O
lead- O
team O
leads O
, O
uh O
I O
and O
then O
have O
operations O
specialist O
. O

We O
have O
, O
you O
know O
, O
I O
-- O
team O
managers O
, O
training O
managers O
. O

It O
's O
a O
very O
big O
company O
. O

Yeah O
, O
and O
I O
think O
that O
the O
atmosphere O
is O
very O
good O
, O
I O
Bill O
Right O
. O

Alexander O
Yeah O
. O

Bill O
Well O
, O
I O
think O
that O
's O
important O
to O
to O
have O
a O
good O
atmosphere O
and O
also O
, O
uh O
, O
uh O
, O
i- O
know O
who O
who O
really O
is O
in O
charge O
, O
uh O
, O
you O
know O
, O
and O
and O
know O
who O
you O
have O
to O
answer O
to O
. O

Because O
sometimes O
, O
y- O
I O
I O
I O
did O
I O
years O
ago O
I O
had O
a O
company O
that O
was O
, O
uh O
, O
it O
was O
, O
uh O
, O
I O
was O
a O
subs- O
s- O
captive O
sub-contractor O
for O
making O
packaging O
material O
. O

And O
, O
um O
, O
there O
were O
a O
lot O
of O
salesmen O
in O
the O
company O
, O
they O
had O
a O
tendency O
to O
, O
you O
know O
, O
there O
was O
there O
was O
, O
uh O
, O
a O
chain O
of O
command O
, O
you O
might O
say O
. O

You O
know O
, O
there O
was O
, O
uh O
, O
the O
person O
that O
was O
the O
, O
uh O
, O
head O
of O
the O
organization O
. O

But O
, O
all O
the O
salesmen O
-- O
used O
to O
come O
around O
and O
give O
orders O
, O
too O
, O
you O
know O
. O

So O
it O
made O
it O
kind O
of O
difficult O
for O
the O
m- O
for O
my O
employees O
, O
because O
they O
would O
the O
salesmen O
would O
be O
coming O
out O
, O
uh O
, O
uh O
, O
without O
consulting O
with O
the O
one O
that O
was O
in O
charge O
. O

They O
would O
just O
be O
coming O
out O
and O
giving O
orders O
when O
they O
should O
already O
went O
through O
him O
. O

So O
it O
made O
it O
difficult O
. O

So O
I O
I O
I O
think O
it's O
really O
important O
to O
h- O
have O
that O
really O
clear O
. O

That O
that O
there O
's O
some O
organized O
way O
to O
deal O
with O
, O
uh O
, O
problems O
and O
orders O
and O
things O
like O
that O
, O
and O
if O
there O
is O
a O
problem O
, O
then O
-- O
you O
go O
to O
the O
person O
who O
's O
in O
charge O
and O
-- O
then O
they O
can O
handle O
it O
. O

So O
, O
that O
was O
-- O
that O
that O
's O
just O
a O
you O
know O
, O
a O
-- O
previous O
, O
uh O
, O
type O
of O
work O
that O
I O
had O
. O

And O
I O
and O
tha- O
I O
think O
that O
's O
what O
they O
wanted O
us O
to O
talk O
about O
, O
too O
, O
right O
? O

Alexander O
Yeah O
. O

Yeah O
, O
that O
's O
that O
's O
that O
's O
I O
think O
it O
's O
just O
basically O
, O
is O
( O
( O
) O
) O
one O
of O
the O
things O
I O
perceive O
is O
if- O
what O
kind O
of O
, O
you O
know O
, O
environment O
is O
it O
, O
and O
is O
it O
inviting O
is O
it O
, O
you O
know O
, O
all O
that O
they O
I O
guess O
that O
's O
what O
they O
're O
aiming O
at O
. O

You O
know O
, O
it O
's O
not O
a O
place O
where O
everybody O
trying O
to O
give O
instruction O
and O
everybody O
trying O
to O
do O
, O
you O
know O
. O

Uh O
, O
but O
I O
for O
my O
job O
is O
i- O
i- O
-- O
we O
have O
us O
a O
very O
diverse O
feel O
. O

We O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
who O
are O
from O
different O
country O
, O
and O
, O
you O
know O
, O
and O
-- O
I O
think O
they O
are O
pretty O
much O
accepting O
, O
and O
I O
, O
you O
know O
, O
I- O
bas- O
basically O
you- O
you O
can O
promote O
yourself O
if O
you O
do O
a O
good O
job O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
they O
do O
n't O
pick O
and O
choose O
, O
you O
know O
. O

Bill O
Right O
. O

Alexander O
It O
's O
a O
very O
-- O
environment O
that O
allows O
you O
to O
grow O
in O
. O

And O
I O
think O
they O
thinks O
I O
rightfully O
do O
n't O
, O
if O
-- O
like O
if O
I O
have O
a O
problem O
, O
like O
, O
I'll O
freshly O
go O
to O
my O
team O

Bill O
Right O

Yeah O
, O
but O
that O
-- O
I O
feel O
like O
that O
that O
's O
very O
important O
. O

Uh O
, O
for O
a O
company O
to O
be O
well-run O
, O
it O
has O
to O
have O
, O
uh O
, O
a O
c- O
it O
's O
t- O
has O
to O
be O
able O
to O
send O
a O
clear O

who O
who O
is O
the O
one O
that O

uh O
, O
uh O

for O

for O
those O
problems O
-- O
to O
handle O

And O
and O
people O
-- O
those O
in O
the O
company O
need O
to O
be O
um O
instructed O
-- O
to O
know O
wh- O
where O
their O
relative O
place O
is O
in O
the O
company O
. O

So O
that O
they O
they O
do O
n't O
overstep O
their O
bounds O
. O

Alexander O

Bill O
Because O
when O

it O
that O

, O
uh O
, O
that O

for O
the O

I O
've O
let O
them O

family O

and O
that O
seems O
to O
have O
been O
a O

A O
he O

the O

B O
Oh O

that O

right O

Okay O

A O
And O
um O
after O

B O
Now O
I O

A O
he O
before O

I O

then O
after O

B O
Uh-huh O

A O
uh O
Secretary O

him O

or O
for O
someone O
, O
but O
him O
being O
the O
person O
at O
that O
time O
. O

I O
just O
think O
that O
B O
Yeah O
. O

Yeah O
. O

A O
it O
's O
so O
soon O
-- O
since O
nine O
eleven O
, O
and O
he O
has O
been O
creating O
his O
own O
job O
, O
i- O
in O
essence O
, O
because O
it O
's O
such O
a O
new O
position O
. O

But O
, O
I O
think O
it O
's O
-- O
it O
would O
've O
been O
-- O
better O
to O
have O
one O
person O
-- O
like O
continuing O
that O
. O

However O
, O
B O
I O
do O
too O
. O

I O
I O
do O
too O
. O

I O
hate O
to O
I O
hate O
to O
change O
-- O
change O
horses O
there O
so O
quickly O
. O

A O
yeah O
. O

B O
Uh O
I O
I O
I O
'd O
that O
-- O
that O
-- O
job O
uh O
uh O
needs O
continuity O
-- O
for O
a O
while O
. O

Anyhow O
. O

You O
know O
, O
I O
m- O
I O
mean O
, O
at O
least O
until O
they O
get O
A O
Yeah O
. O

B O
settled O
on O
what O
the O
job O
really O
is O
. O

A O
Yeah O
, O
well O
uh O
maybe O
maybe O
on O
one O
hand O
-- O
somebody O
new O
will O
bring O
a O
new O
perspective O
to O
it O
, O
which O
would O
-- O
be O
helpful O
, O
but O
I O
still O
think O
that O
B O
Uh O
yeah O
A O
the O
people O
that O
are O
up O
for O
it O
-- O
there O
's O
some O
p- O
B O
Yeah O
, O
but O
if O
it O
's O
if O
the O
perspective O
is O
too O
new O
, O
you O
know O
, O
that O
's O
not O
going O
to O
be O
a O
good O
thing O
, O
because O
uh O
wholesale O
changes O
is O
not O
what O
they O
need O

A O
yeah O
. O

Yeah O
. O

B O
Uh O
uh O
no O

who O
takes O
it O
over O
. O

They O
need O
to O
they O
need O
to O
-- O
think O
long O
and O
hard O
before O
they O
start O
making O
changes O
. O

Because O
if O
they O
make O
one O
wrong O
one O
, O
you O
know O
, O
it O
A O
But O
there O
are O
there O
are O
a O
couple O
women O
up O
for O

the O
position O
as O

as O
um O
you O
know O

a O
few O

are O

I O

B O

A O

they O

so O

I O

, O
I O
think O
they O
have O
some O
qualified O

through O

So O
, O
as O
long O
as O
they O
do O
n't O
have O
blinders O
on O
, O
you O
know O
, O
I O
would O
be O
okay O
with O
that O
, O
but O
they O
've O
got O
to O
look O
, O
obviously O

at O

nuclear O

, O
you O
know O

and O
oth- O
other O
areas O
where O
we O

B O
Yeah O
. O

Yeah O
, O
and O
you O
know O
what O
's O
really O
scary O
to O
me O
? O

I O
I O
do O
n't O
I've O
never O
seen O
it O
mentioned O
, O
I O
've O
never O
-- O
but O
-- O
but O
if O
they O
really O
wanted O
to O
to O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
uh O
uh O
uh O
if O
they O
if O
they O
really O
wanted O
to O
put O
-- O
fear O
in O
the O
American B-LOC
people O
, O
uh O
-- O
I O
know O
it O
would O
work O
with O
me O
, O
is O
if O
they O
say O
just O
uh O
if O
if O
-- O
I O
say O
they O
, O
Bin O
Laden O
, O
or O
who O
whoever O
-- O
uh O
-- O
uh O
is O
running O
that O
team O
now O
, O
uh O
were O
to O

were O
to O
just O
pick O
a O
small O

Mid- B-LOC
American I-LOC
town O
, O
A O
Mhm O
. O

B O
uh O
and O
just O
wipe O
it O
out O
, O
A O
Yeah O
, O
no O
, O
and O
I O
I O
thi- O
I O
think O
that O
's O
a O
great O
fear O
. O

B O
you O
know O
, O
and O
there O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
ways O
-- O
there O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
ways O
to O
do O
that O
. O

I O
mean O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
it O
would O
n't O
take O
a O
nuclear O
weapon O
. O

A O
No O
, O
no O
. O

B O
uh O
uh O
and O
it O
it O
could O
be O
done O
so O
easily O
because O
i- O
i- O
most O
small O
towns O
are O
protected O
by O
a O
small O
town O
police O
force O
. O

A O
Mhm O
. O

B O
You O
know O
? O

And O
that O
's O
it O
. O

A O
Well O
, O
I O
think O
that O
-- O
there O
's O
-- O
really O
-- O
been O
a O
strengthening O
, O
and O
I O
hope O
they O
can O
-- O
get O
it O
together O
without O
this O

Part O
of O
the O
problem O
with O
that O
is O
the O
~CIA B-ORG

the O
~FBI B-ORG
and O
who O
's O
going O
to O
be O
in O
charge O
because O
they O
want O
to O
create O
this O

. O

B O
( O
( O
I O
) O
) O
No O
, O
they O
've O
always O
A O
And O
, O
so O
nobody O
wants O
to O

give O
up O

power O
B O
Yeah O
. O

A O
and O
, O
you O
know O
, O
you O
-- O
in O
this O
case O

and O
going O

we O

uh O
topic O
of O

this O
evening O
? O

Sherri O
I O
've O
been O
sort O
of O
surprised O
. O

Eh O
uh O
I O
-- O
I O
heard O
uh O
that O
Colin O
Powell O
wanted O
um O
-- O
to O
resign O
last O
year O
and O
they O
talked O
him O
out O
of O
it O
. O

Ron O
Uh-huh O
, O
uh-huh O
. O

Sherri O
Or O
something O
like O
that O
and O
uh O
so O
-- O
I O
was O
still O
surprised O
this O
year O
when O
Ron O
Oh O
thi- O
you O
were O
surprised O
that O
he O
yo- O
that O
he O
decided O
to O
step O
down O
. O

Sherri O
yeah O
I O
I O
I O
still O
was O
uh O
-- O
kind O
of O
surprised O
. O

Ron O
Oh O
, O
huh O
, O
how O
interesting O
. O

Sherri O
eh O
-- O
And O
uh O
-- O
and O
then O
uh O
with O
Condoleezza O
Rice O
. O

They O
're O
appointing O
her O
ta- O
to O
a O
new O
position O
, O
and O
I O
was O
surprised O
about O
Ashcroft O
. O

Ron O
Uh-huh O
, O
uh-huh O
. O

Sherri O
I O
was O
n't O
like O
it O
and O
then O
Tom O
Ridge O
yesterday O
. O

Ron O
Yeah O
, O
I O
saw O
that O
. O

Yeah O
, O
I O
I O
uh O
that O
one O
I O
think O
one O
probably O
was O
the O
one O
that O
most O
surprised O
me O
. O

I O
had O
n't O
I O
had O
n't O
really O
thought O
about O
it O
. O

I O
-- O
Colin O
Powell O
did O
n't O
surprise O
me O
. O

Ashcroft O
surprised O
me O
a O
little O
bit O
um O
but O
um O
I O
sort O
of O
started O
to O
think O
he O
might O
step O
down O
because O
evidently O
he O
was O
being O
he O
was O
considered O
somewhat O
of O
a O
lightning O
rod O
for O
um O
you O
know O
some O
of O
his O
more O
controversial O
stands O
and O
stuff O
so O
. O

Sherri O
Uh-huh O
. O

Ron O
But O
and O
and O
so O
have O
you O
been O
following O
the O
uh O
the O
proposed O
nominees O
? O

I O
mean O
do O
you O
think O
Sherri O
Kellogg B-ORG
, O
the O
Kellogg B-ORG
guy O
. O

Ron O
Oh O
yeah O
, O
that O
's O
right O
. O

Where O
's O
he O
going O
to O
Commerce B-ORG
? O

Is O
that O
where O
he O
's O
headed O
? O

Sherri O
Yeah O
, O
that O
's O
it O
, O
huh O
? O

Ron O
Yeah O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
anything O
about O
him O
. O

I O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

Do O
you O
know O
anything O
about O
him O
? O

Sherri O
Mm O
. O

Well O
, O
all O
I O
know O
is O
that O
that O
's O
like O
a O
real O
prestigious O
uh O
position O
, O
you O
know O
to O
be O
the O
what O
the O
~CEO O
of O
Kellogg B-ORG
? O

Ron O
Yeah O
, O
yeah O
. O

I O
guess O
it O
sort O
of O
concerns O
me O
that O
uh O
you O
know O
we're O
looking O
at O
yet O
uh O
another O
corporate O
head O
coming O
into O
the O
government O
. O

I O
Sherri O
Mm O
. O

Ye- O
ye- O
you O
know O
, O
this O
is O
like O
a O
-- O
uh O
it O
's O
a O
re- O
-- O
I O
think O
we O
have O
a O
real O
problem O
. O

That O
is O
uh O
-- O
you O
know O
almost O
like O
a O
big O
beast O
you O
know O
that O
's O
right O
there O
and O
we O
do O
n't O
even O
identify O
it O
Ron O
Uh-huh O
. O

Uh-huh O
, O
uh-huh O
. O

Sherri O
way O
way O
way O
more O
than O
we O
realize O
. O

Ron O
Yeah O
, O
I O
I O
think O
you O
're O
probably O
right O
and O
I O
think O
it O
-- O
maybe O
even O
particularly O
true O
under O
this O
President O
, O
although O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
it's O
just O
limited O
to O
him O
. O

I O
think O
it O
's O
a O
common O
problem O
in O
the O
~US B-LOC
. O

Sherri O
I O
f- O
-- O
I O
uh O
I O
think O
i- O
i- O
it O
's O
uh O
more O
evident O
now O
than O
ever O
. O

Ron O
Uh-huh O
, O
uh-huh O
Sherri O
You O
know O
, O
really O
um O
-- O
tremen- O
tremendously O
a O
ruling O
and O
reigning O
. O

Ron O
Did O
you O
um O
Sherri O
I O
think O
it O
it O
's O
a O
global O
uh O
has O
a O
global O
effect O
. O

Ron O
Yeah O
. O

Sherri O
I O
think O
that O
's O
why O
Al-Qaeda B-ORG
-- O
took O
down O
the O
the O
uh O
twin O
towers O
. O

Eh O
w- O
they O
were O
making O
a O
a O
statement O
. O

Uh O
I O
think O
something O
like O
that O
possibly O
, O
that O
it O
had O
to O
do O
with O
corporate O
America O
. O

Ron O
Uh-huh O
, O
you O
mean O
about O
the O
corporate O
thing O
? O

Sherri O
Hm O
? O

Ron O
Uh O
you O
mean O
because O
of O
its O
-- O
what O
it O
represented O
around O
corporate O
America O
or O
something O
? O

Is O
that O
what O
you O
think O
. O

Sherri O
I O
think O
what O
corporate O
America O
represents O
-- O
you O
know O
the O
the O
financial O
scheme O
of O
it O
all O
, O
the O
Ron O
Uh-huh O
, O
uh-huh O
. O

Sherri O
the O
it O
just O
how O
it O
eff- O
effects O
the O
globe O
, O
Ron O
Mhm O
. O

Sherri O
and O
how O
eh O
it O
effects O
third O
world O
countries O
and O
you O
know O
just O
the O
whole O
thing O
. O

It O
's O
just O
Ron O
Mhm O
, O
mhm O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Sherri O
it O
's O
a O
you O
know O
like O
a O
a O
a O
wealthy O
despotism O
or O
something O
like O
that O
. O

Ron O
So O
any O
thoughts O
on O
who O
you O
uh O
you O
would O
name O
? O

Sherri O
( O
( O
) O
) O
-- O
You O
know O
who O
I O
would O
name O
? O

I O
know O
this O
is O
really O
wild O
. O

Ron O
Do O
you O
suppose O
? O

Uh-huh O
. O

Sherri O
But O
uh O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
you O
'll O
probably O
really O
laugh O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
I O
I O
I O
always O
thought O
that O
-- O
Ralph O
Nader O
was O
kind O
of O
a O
a O
character O
Ron O
Oh O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Sherri O
but O
what O
I O
really O
I O
mean O
I O
really O
listened O
to O
what O
he O
said O
when O
he O
was O
being O
interviewed O
Ron O
Mhm O
. O

Sherri O
and O
in O
just O
a O
few O
words O
, O
he O
did O
n't O
mince O
any O
meat O
or O
anything O
, O
in O
a O
few O
words O
he O
said O
so O
much O
that O
was O
so O
Ron O
Uh-huh O
. O

Sherri O
like O
-- O
like O
a O
clarion O
call O
it O
rang O
so O
clear O
. O

You O
could O
hear O
what O
he O
was O
saying O
and O
it O
was O
really O
making O
sense O
, O
and O
I O
think O
he O
's O
an O
expert O
Ron O
So O
who O
would O
y- O
what O
would O
you O
appoint O
him O
to O
? O

Sherri O
on O
Ron O
Any O
particular O
position O
? O

I O
mean O
, O
I O
think O
that O
's O
a O
good O
idea O
. O

Sherri O
eh O
-- O
there O
's O
something O
to O
do O
with O
the O
economy O
y- O
you O
know O
for O
the O
with O
the O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
Ron O
Yeah O
. O

Sherri O
just O
uh O
-- O
like O
a O
an O
equa- O
e- O
economic O
equilibrium O
or O
something O
. O

Ron O
He O
might O
be O
be O
good O
at O
-- O
yeah O
, O
he O
might O
be O
good O
at O

ever O
been O
there O
B O
Yeah O
, O
I O
went O
there O
( O
( O
before O
) O
) O
A O
has O
has O
has O
got O
some O
-- O
different O
rules O
from O
Texas B-LOC
as O
far O
as O
-- O
you O
know O
you O
know O
, O
running O
the O
city O
. O

I O
mean O
I O
, O
there O
's O
a O
lot O
lot O
more O
people O
dense O
population O
up O
there O
than O
there O
is O
in O
in O
Texas B-LOC
and O
they O
probably O
would O
have O
uh O
the O
pol- O
uh O
the O
police O
chief O
would O
probably O
know O
-- O
well O
what O
can O
work O
in O
like O
, O
airports O
or O
, O
you O
know O
, O
things O
, O
situations O
like O
that O
. O

He O
was O
, O
he O
was O
a O
pretty O
good O
-- O
pretty O
smart O
person O
. O

But O
I O
, O
it O
did O
n't O
-- O
I O
ca O
n't O
remember O
his O
name O
, O
but O
-- O
the O
, O
I O
saw O
an O
interview O
with O
him O
, O
and O
-- O
how O
he O
, O
uh O
-- O
ran O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
and O
uh O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
some O
of O
the O
-- O
ru- O
you O
know O
, O
they O
changed O
some O
of O
the O
rules O
, O
uh O
-- O
uh O
, O
not O
rules O
, O
but O
the O
way O
they O
-- O
uh O
B O
The O
management O
team O
A O
protected O
the O
city O
. O

The O
the O
police O
kind O
of O
changed O
their O
tactics O
and O
, O
because O
there O
was O
a O
lot O
of O
-- O
oh O
-- O
run O
down O
areas O
, O
and O
a O
lot O
of O
crime O
and O
they O
, O
you O
know O
-- O
got O
-- O
cleaned O
it O
up O
, O
and O
and O
-- O
they O
passed O
some O
laws O
that O
said O
, O
you O
know O
, O
you O
could O
n't O
, O
I O
think O
it O
was O
like O
, O
um O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
like O
homeless O
people O
that O
-- O
carrying O
-- O
uh O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
shopping O
carts O
, O
or O
something O
like O
that O
, O
and O
it O
sounds O
-- O
small O
-- O
to O
outlaw O
that O
. O

But O
they O
outlawed O
that O
because O
they O
said O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
were O
stealing O
stuff O
. O

They O
'd O
stick O
them O
in O
the O
shopping O
carts O
and O
push O
them O
down O
the O
road O
. O

You O
would O
n't O
know O
, O
oh O
, O
they O
're O
just O
a O
homeless O
person O
. O

Well O
they O
cut O
that O
out O
and O
they O
found O
out O
-- O
it O
cut O
down O
on O
the O
theft O
. O

Uh O
-- O
I O
guess O
people O
-- O
hide O
them O
in O
their O
basket O
and O
-- O
or O
taking O
something O
and O
then O
stick O
in O
their O
basket O
and O
the O
police O
never O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
bothered O
them O
. O

Well O
, O
the O
homeless O
people O
-- O
I O
guess O
, O
they O
need O
their O
shopping O
cart O
, O
so O
they O
kind O
of O
went O
elsewhere O
, O
so O
-- O
um O
-- O
I O
mean O
it O
's O
a O
small O
thing O
, O
but O
it O
was O
, O
they O
just O
figured O
out O
, O
they O
were O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
uh O
-- O
learning O
from O
experience O
on O
what O
they O
need O
to O
do O
in O
the O
-- O
city O
and O
-- O
I O
think O
he O
would O
be O
a O
good O
-- O
candidate O
for O
the O
Homeland O
Security O
, O
running O
that O
. O

B O
But O
, O
eh O
, O
for O
the O
foreign O
po- O
uh O
this O
is O
all O
all O
what O
you O
are O
saying O
is O
like O
, O
about O
the O
internal O
-- O
but O
what O
about O
the O
external O
policy O
or O
something O
like O
that O
? O

Whom O
do O
you O
think O
would O
be O
suitable O
? O

A O
The O
what O
now O
policy O
? O

B O
Like O
, O
eh O
, O
foreign O
po- O
or O
international O
policy O
or O
external O
or O
A O
Mhm O
. O

B O
uh O
, O
whom O
do O
you O
think O
-- O
would O
be O
suitable O
for O
this O
position O
? O

A O
To O
run O
foreign O
policy O
? O

Um O
-- O
like O
, O
uh O
-- O
well O
, O
it O
was O
-- O
Colin O
Powell O
was O
Secretary O
, O
was O
he O
Secretary O
of O
State O
? O

Is O
that O
what O
that O
was O
? O

B O
Yeah O
. O

A O
And O
Condoleezza O
Rice O
is O
going O
to O
step O
into O
that O
position O
, O
the O
way O
I O
understand O
it O
, O
uh O
. O

B O
Yeah O
, O
that O
's O
right O
. O

A O
Yes O
. O

You O
know O
, O
she O
may O
be O
-- O
uh O
uh O
uh O
, O
you O
know O
, O
uh O
-- O
a O
uh O
Bush O
yes O
person O
, O
you O
know O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
uh O
B O
Yeah O
, O
so O
I O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
this O
will O
change O
too O
much O
I O
mean O
. O

A O
well O
mo- O
most O
-- O
most O
-- O
aides O
to O
the O
President O
, O
if O
it O
was O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
I O
guess O
when O
it O
was O
Clinton O
it O
was O
, O
they O
'd O
probably O
be O
kind O
of O
yes O
people O
too O
, O
but O
, O
I O
mean O
they O
pick O
the O
person O
to O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
help O
them O
and O
I O
guess O
they O
're O
going O
to O
have O
to O
have O
-- O
philosophies O
and O
and O
-- O
run O
it O
the O
way O
they O
would O
or O
way O
they O
'd O
want O
, O
uh O
B O
Yeah O
, O
actually O
I O
agree O
with O
you O
. O

I O
think O
uh O
-- O
during O
, O
uh O
, O
Clinton O
time O
uh O
-- O
the O
uh O
like O
international O
policy O
or O
the O
external O
policy O
was O
-- O
was O
much O
better O
than O
-- O
uh O
what O
what O
is O
happening O
right O
now O
, O
so O
. O

I O
think O
if O
we O
took O
Bill O
Clin- O
Bill O
Clinton O
as O
like O
, O
as O
a O
foreign O
policy O
-- O
He O
he O
would O
be O
he O
will O
do O
a O
very O
good O
job O
. O

I O
I O
would O
say O
. O

A O
Mhm O
. O

B O
Uh O
, O
do O
you O
think O
there O
is O
uh O
-- O
some O
other O
, O
uh O
like O
-- O
positions O
has O
to O
be O
has O
been O
-- O
has O
to O
be O
created O
, O
like O
uh O
-- O
for O
the O
next O
election O
. O

A O
I O
'm O
s- O
-- O
say O
that O
again O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
understand O
. O

B O
I O
mean O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
is O
there O
any O
other O
, O
eh O
, O
positions O
or O
-- O
Uh O
, O
like O
uh O
, O
has O
to O
be O
created O
like O
the O
-- O
uh O
-- O
election O
. O

I O
mean O
-- O
uh O
, O
for O
example O
they O
they O
made O
, O
uh O
-- O
a O
position O
for O
like O
, O
uh O
-- O
internal O
eh O
, O
security O
-- O
I O
I O
think O
after O
, O
eh O
September O
eleventh O
A O
Mhm O
. O

B O
they O
created O
a O
position O
like O
that O
. O

Do O
you O
think O
there O
is O
-- O
some O
other O
position O
has O
eh O
have O
to O
be O
created O
? O

A O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
so O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
you O
need O
-- O
uh O
-- O
you O
never O
know O
what's O
go- O
going O
to O
happen O
, O
I O
mean O

what O
could O

Bush O
Cabinet O
President O
Bush O
has O
just O
been O
elected O
to O
another O
term O
in O
office O
, O
and O
he O
has O
already O
started O
to O
appoint O
new O
people O
to O
his O
political O
cabinet O
as O
current O
members O
like O
Colin O

resign O

Who O
would O
you O
like O
to O
see O
appointed O
to O

? O

Who O
are O
they O
, O
and O
why O
do O
you O

they O
should O
be O
appointed O
? O

If O
you O
were O

which O
national O
figures O
would O
you O
appoint O
to O
your O

why O
? O

What O

you O

who O

A O
Um O

and O
then O
I O
I O
do O
n't O
-- O
know O
who O
would O
you O
who O
else O
would O
you O
-- O
well O
what O
about O
Ruly O
-- O
Rudolph O
Giuliani O
B O
Well O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

I O
you O
know O
what O
? O

I O
think O
-- O
I O
think O
Rudy O
Giuliani O
was O
a O
great O
mayor O
-- O
for O
nine O
eleven O
. O

A O
Right O
. O

B O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
he O
was O
a O
great O
mayor O
the O
whole O
time O
he O
was O
a O
mayor O
. O

A O
Well O
, O
I O
I O
'm O
a O
New O
Yorker O
, O
and O
I O
got O
to O
tell O
you O
that O
I O
I O
think O
nine O
eleven O
I O
I O
think O
-- O
basically O
made O
him O
. O

Other O
than O
that O
, O
I O
think O
he O
was O
a O
little O
too O
decisive O
. O

B O
Yeah O
. O

A O
Uh O
not O
I O
should O
n't O
say O
decisive O
, O
too O
divisive O
. O

B O
Yeah O
, O
I O
think O
he O
A O
As O
far O
as O
-- O
the O
race O
relationship O
in O
this O
city O
. O

You O
know O
, O
it O
doesn't O
take O
much O
to O
to O
please O
-- O
the O
other O
side O
. O

And O
that O
and O
that O
's O
what O
government O
is O
all O
about O
. O

B O
no O
, O
it O
does O
n't O
. O

A O
And O
he O
-- O
he O
was O
n't O
-- O
he O
was O
n't O
too O
much O
of O
a O
good O
uh O
B O
He O
he O
would O
've O
gone O
out O
as O
a O
mediocre O
mayor O
had O
it O
not O
. O

And O
I O
but O
even O
even O
saying O
that O
I O
ca O
n't O
begrudge O
him O
. O

But O
he O
did O
a O
great O
job O
in O
the O
crisis O
. O

Some O
people O
do O
better O
in O
crises O
. O

A O
Yeah O
. O

Exactly O
. O

Exactly O
, O
exactly O
, O
I O
I O
think O
that O
nine O
eleven O
made O
him O
and O
B O
Yeah O
. O

A O
and O
at O
that O
point O
in O
time O
, O
he O
wanted O
to O
stay O
on O
, O
which O
was O
sort O
of O
sort O
of O
ridiculous O
. O

B O
And O
if O
if O
if O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
country O
knows O
that O
, O
because O
they O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
he O
did O
before O
nine O
eleven O
, O
because O
they O
do O
n't O
pay O
any O
attention O
. O

A O
Eh O
-- O
Exactly O
. O

Exactly O
, O
of O
course O
, O
you O
're O
right O
, O
you O
're O
quite O
right O
. O

B O
And O
-- O
I O
think O
that O
if O
he O
did O
get O
a O
government O
agency O
, O
it O
would O
have O
to O
be O
one O
that O
was O
having O
crisis O
a O
lot O
of O
times O
I O
mean O
, O
he O
would O
just O
have O
to O
devote O
himself O
to O
that O
. O

If O
he O
could O
just O
do O
that O
, O
it O
would O
be O
fine O
. O

A O
It O
's O
a O
good O
point O
. O

B O
But O
if O
he O
gets O
if O
gets O
into O
a O
lot O
of O
policy O
making O
and O
stuff O
that O
for O
other O
things O
, O
you O
know O
, O
A O
Yeah O
, O
yeah O
. O

Yeah O
, O
I O
I O
I O
I O
know O
I O
one O
of O
the O
B O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

Probably O
would O
be O
a O
good O
attorney O
general O
, O
he O
did O
that O
A O
it O
could O
very O
well O
, O
he O
did O
a O
good O
job O
, O
you O
're O
right O
, O
he O
probably O
could O
follow O
in O
what O
's O
his O
name O
's O
footsteps O
. O

B O
you O
know O
. O

I O
think O
I O
think O
the O
cases O
that O
he O
picks O
and O
chooses O
probably O
I O
would O
n't O
necessarily O
put O
on O
top O
of O
the O
list O
, O
but O
he O
did O
seem O
to O
A O
Right O
. O

B O
prosecute O
everybody O
evenly O
. O

A O
Yeah O
. O

That O
much O
I O
think O
we O
can O
we O
can O
probably O
agree O
with O
. O

He O
will O
probably O
do O
that O
evenly O
. O

B O
Yes O
. O

Right O
. O

A O
I O
you O
know O
who O
I O
thought O
would O
have O
made O
a O
great O
, O
uh O
well O
I O
I O
know O
you O
guys O
had O
your O
own O
political O
uh O
struggles O
in O
Jersey B-LOC
. O

B O
Right O
. O

Yeah O
. O

A O
Um O
and O
uh O
B O
It O
's O
a O
soap O
opera O
. O

A O
oh O
it O
certainly O
was O
, O
I O
I O
saw O
the O
footage O
. O

I O
B O
Right O
, O
right O
, O
all O
of O
a O
sudden O
. O

I O
'll O
tell O
you O
this O
. O

Within O
one O
day O
, O
everybody O
I O
met O
said O
-- O
oh O
, O
McGreevey O
, O
sure O
, O
I O
knew O
that O
. O

A O
Oh O
really O
? O

B O
That O
became O
the O
national O
thing O
to O
say O
in O
Jersey B-LOC
, O
and O
in O
Jersey B-LOC
. O

Like O
, O
everybody O
knew O
it O
, O
I O
'd O
be O
like O
, O
you O
did O
not O
. O

Nobody O
knew O
that O
. O

A O
In O
Jersey B-LOC
? O

Yeah O
I O
think O
I O
was O
-- O
I O
think O
I O
was O
-- O
I O
was O
on O
a O
cruise O
, O
and O
I O
put O
on O
the O
television O
uh O
when O
I O
got O
in O
at O
the O
six O
oh O
clock O
news O
, O
and O
bingo O
, O
there O
he O
is O
, O
uh O
resigning O
as O
Governor O
of O
uh O
New B-LOC
Jersey I-LOC
. O

I O
said O
, O
you O
've O
got O
to O
be O
kidding O
me O
. O

B O
Yeah O
. O

A O
But O
uh O
-- O
I O
thought O
he O
would O
have O
made O
a O
name O
for O
himself O
. O

um O
-- O
I O
I O
ca O
n't O
think O
of O
anyone O
anyone O
that O
anyone O
else O
out O
there O
that O
um O
-- O
that O
warrants O
. O

I O
mean O
, O
you O
know O
, O
you O
just O
B O
No O
. O

A O
pick O
people O
who O
I O
think O
will O
uh O
-- O
have O
the O
experience O
in O
government O
. O

Well O
not O
in O
, O
not O
in O
government O
, O
but O
in O
the O
private O
sector O
. O

Um O
-- O
who O
are O
responsible O
, O
and O
um O
-- O
put O
them O
in O
a O
position O
to O
lead O
. O

B O
Well O
, O
Yeah O
, O
I O
think O
uh O
-- O
apparently O
-- O
the O
President O
likes O
people O
that O
are O
the O
same O
philo- O
-- O
political O
philosophy O
as O
him O
, O
and O
I O
'm O
not O
sure O
I O
mean O
I O
think O
he O
just O
needs O
some O
other O
voices O
in O
there O
, O
but O
A O
That O
's O
right O
. O

B O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
it O
'll O
happen O

A O
I O

well O
I O

could O
look O
at O
it O
that O
way O
, O
yeah O
. O

B O
eh O
A O
Um O

Um O

I O
did O
n't O
particularly O
like O
the O
the O
tone O
about O
the O
the O
religious O
uh O
-- O
side O
of O

the O
that O

I O
I O
thought O
that O
was O
a O
little O
crazy O
. O

B O
Yeah O
, O
I O
think O
pretty O
wack O
. O

A O
If O
it O
's O
one O
thing O
we O
need O
to O
be O
careful O
about O
, O
it O
's O
separating O
the O
Church O
from O
B O
Exactly O
, O
I O
'm O
a O
pastor O
, O
and O
that O
bothers O
me O
. O

A O
and O
-- O
uh O
-- O
Yeah O
. O

Oh O
I O
I O
'm O
glad O
to O
hear O
some O
uh O
an O
actual O
pastor O
who O
says O
that O
. O

I O
I O
I O
think O
that O
we O
need O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
that O
that O
B O
Yeah O

A O
that O
stays O
the O
way O
it O
is O

Ooh O
, O
Scott O
Peterson O

I O
was O
like O
, O
I O
got O
to O
talk O
to O
someone O
about O
this O
. O

I O
have O
to O
voice O
my O
opinion O
. O

Well O
, O
no O
, O
I O
mean O
you O
could O
go O
or O
, O
well O
Greg O
Uh O
, O
I O
-- O
Okay O
, O
go O
ahead O
. O

Hey O
shoot O
, O
you O
got O
more O
sense O
than O
I O
do O
. O

Christina O
Okay O
, O
I O
-- O
have O
been O
following O
the O
trial O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
why O
, O
ever O
since O
this O
whole O
thing O
happened O
. O

I O
am O
a O
stay O
at O
home O
mom O
, O
so O
I O
get O
to O
watch O
the O
~TV O
more O
often O
, O
and O
I O
-- O
you O
know O
have O
been O
fo- O
-- O
watching O
all O
these O
forensic O
pathologists O
, O
Dr. O
Henry O
Lee O
. O

You O
know O
, O
and O
and O
what O
I O
see O
is O
that O
there O
is O
no O
physical O
evidence O
that O
he O
did O
it O
. O

And O
yeah O
, O
it O
sounds O
like O
he O
did O
do O
it O
because O
he O
dyed O
his O
hair O
, O
was O
trying O
to O
get O
away O
, O
and O
the O
anchor O
and O
a O
boat O
. O

But O
there O
's O
-- O
-- O
I O
for O
some O
reason O
, O
deep O
down O
in O
my O
heart O
, O
do O
n't O
believe O
he O
did O
it O
. O

And O
you O
know O
and O
I O
think O
the O
media O
made O
him O
guilty O
, O
and O
I O
think O
-- O
it O
's O
like O
you O
know O
, O
I O
mean O
you O
saw O
what O
happened O
outside O
the O
courtroom O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
you O
did O
or O
not O
, O
see O
how O
they O
were O
cheering O
on O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
he's O
guilty O
and O
, O
I O
hope O
he O
does O
n't O
get O
the O
death O
penalty O
. O

And O
-- O
I O
don't O
know O
. O

I O
I O
just O
do O
n't O
think O
he O
's O
guilty O
. O

I O
think O
he O
's O
wrong O
, O
what O
he O
did O
, O
everything O
, O
he O
cheated O
on O
his O
wife O
, O
that O
's O
so O
wrong O
, O
but O
-- O
that O
does O
n't O
make O
him O
a O
murderer O
, O
he O
's O
just O
a O
cheater O
, O
he O
's O
just O
a O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
like O
one O
hundred O
ten O
percent O
you O
know O
eighteen O
karat O
-- O
asshole O
, O
like O
i- O
Mar- O
Mark O
Geragos O
called O
him O
. O

Greg O
Yeah O
. O

Christina O
How O
about O
you O
? O

You O
probably O
think O
he O
's O
guilty O
, O
or O
Greg O
Well O
-- O
Yeah O
, O
no O
I O
, O
I O
think O
, O
I O
think O
( O
( O
the O
guy O
's O
) O
) O
definitely O
guilty O
uh O
Just O
based O
on O
, O
I O
have O
n't O
followed O
it O
all O
that O
closely O
, O
although O
you O
ca O
n't O
help O
but O
follow O
it O
closely O
because O
there O
's O
so O
much O
crap O
on O
the O
news O
. O

Christina O
Mhm O
. O

Greg O
But O
uh O
no O
i- O
the O
-- O
uh O
the O
I O
think O
well O
first O
of O
all O
, O
you O
know O
I O
agree O
with O
you O
, O
I O
think O
cheating O
on O
your O
wife O
's O
pretty O
low O
. O

But O
I O
think O
what O
happened O
i- O
it O
's O
living O
the O
b- O
uh O
living O
large O
. O

You O
could O
tell O
both O
of O
them O
uh O
you O
look O
some O
of O
the O
things O
they O
had O
, O
you O
know O
, O
he O
had O
a O
few O
bucks O
or O
so O
. O

( O
( O
) O
) O
finish O
, O
things O
were O
getting O
him O
down O
, O
uh O
you O
know O
, O
you O
know O
how O
it O
is O
, O
day O
after O
day O
though O
-- O
M- O
marriage O
isn't O
all O
that O
wonderful O
. O

Christina O
Right O
. O

Greg O
Eh O
, O
you O
know O
and O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
he O
had O
faced O
that O
, O
and O
plus O
, O
you O
know O
, O
a O
lot O
of O
the O
neat O
stuff O
from O
the O
outside O
, O
and O
particularly O
Amber O
Frey O
, O
who O
I O
do O
n't O
particularly O
think O
is O
neat O
, O
but O
it O
was O
something O
that O
uh O
you O
know O
he O
went O
after O
Christina O
Mhm O
. O

Greg O
and O
so O
uh O
he O
figured O
, O
well O
-- O
these O
will O
, O
these O
things O
would O
get O
rid O
of O
her O
I O
guess O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
why O
like O
his O
uh O
, O
the O
wife O
's O
or O
the O
mother O
said O
divorce O
is O
an O
option O
I O
think O
. O

Christina O
Yeah O
. O

I O
know O
, O
that O
's O
very O
powerful O
. O

Not O
, O
you O
know O
, O
not O
murder O
and O
, O
oh O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

Greg O
But O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
I O
I O
can O
see O
, O
the O
guy O
was O
n't O
thinking O
right O
. O

He O
was O
screwed O
up O
, O
you O
know O
, O
a O
despicable O
human O
being O
and O
he O
, O
just O
-- O
You O
know O
, O
the O
easy O
way O
out O
. O

This O
'll O
work O
, O
I O
guarantee O
I O
'm O
too O
damn O
smart O
. O

Christina O
But O
you O
know O
what O
, O
it O
's O
like O
I O
think O
they O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
find O
him O
guilty O
because O
remember O
when O
~OJ O
was O
not O
found O
guilty O
? O

I O
mean O
, O
oh O
my O
God O
, O
the O
, O
you O
know O
, O
but O
it O
's O
like O
, O
~LA B-LOC
would O
have O
like O
, O
turned O
~LA B-LOC
upside O
down O
, O
like O
all O
the O
, O
you O
know O
Greg O
Yeah O
. O

Christina O
I- O
it O
just O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
would O
happen O
if O
he O
was O
found O
guilty O
, O
but O
now O
I O
think O
they O
said O
that O
they O
wanted O
to O
prove O
that O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
okay O
, O
we O
're O
not O
going O
to O
let O
this O
guy O
walk O
, O
like O
, O
do O
n't O
let O
this O
guy O
walk O
either O
, O
big O
high O
profile O
case O
. O

Greg O
Well O
, O
yeah O
you O
have O
to O
look O

see O
, O
I O
think O

both O

and O
one O
took O
place O
in O
~LA B-LOC

which O
is O
terribly O
open- O

and O

the O
other O

A O

I O
just O

just O
called O

I O
'm O

I O
heard O

I O
'm O

I O
know O
what O
the O
question O

going O

Alithia O

I O

I O

I- O
I O
do O

not O

What O
do O
you O
think O
? O

A O
I O
think O
so O
. O

I O
think O
he O
got O
into O
an O
argument O
with O
her O
and O
he O
pushed O
her O
. O

And O
I O
think O
she O
fell O
and O
maybe O
she O
hit O
her O
head O
or O
something O
and O
it O
killed O
her O
, O
so O
he O
panicked O
. O

Alithia O
What O
about O
the O
baby O
? O

A O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
he O
-- O

I O
thi- O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

I O
don- O
eh O

she O
was O

, O
okay O

Hello O

Mhm O

Kelly O
Hillary O
? O

Hillary O
Yeah O
. O

Kelly O
Hey O
, O
yeah O
, O
okay O
. O

Hillary O
It O
's O
uh O
Kelly O
So O
the O
Hillary O
a O
pretty O
-- O
depressing O
topic O
for O
today O
. O

Kelly O
yeah O
, O
I O
guess O
so O
. O

The O
truth O
is O
I O
do O
n't O
really O
, O
uh O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
really O
know O
much O
about O
that O
topic O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
really O
follow O
the O
trial O
very O
closely O
at O
all O
Hillary O
we O
do O
n't O
have O
, O
uh O
, O
cable O
so O
we O
purposely O
did O
n't O
watch O
the O
trial O
, O
but O
I O
read O
about O
it O
on O
the O
internet O
. O

Kelly O
so O
Hillary O
and O
basically O
Kelly O
Oh O
, O
really O
? O

Hillary O
he O
-- O
killed O
his O
wife O
when O
she O
was O
-- O
eight O
months O
pregnant O
and O
-- O
and O
dumped O
her O
in O
, O
uh O
-- O
the O
ocean O
, O
basically O
. O

Kelly O
So O
why O
was O
it O
so O
special O
? O

Why O
did O
that O
, O
uh O
-- O
particular O
case O
make O
-- O
the O
the O
national O
news O
? O

Hillary O
I O
think O
it O
's O
because O
it O
was O
in O
such O
, O
it O
was O
like O
a O
, O
um O
Kelly O
Like O
Hillary O
it O
was O
-- O
in O
such O
a O
quiet O
, O
upscale O
community O
where O
it O
happened O
and O
-- O
um O
just O
I O
think O
the O
fact O
of O
her O
being O
eight O
months O
pregnant O
, O
um O
, O
drew O
a O
lot O
of O
attention O
and O
Kelly O
Yeah O
. O

Hillary O
of O
course O
people O
were O
worried O
about O
her O
for O
a O
long O
time O
and O
then O
they O
found O
her O
and O
blah O
blah O
blah O
. O

It O
was O
-- O
gossip O
, O
basically O
. O

Kelly O
( O
( O
Yeah O
, O
right O
. O
) O
) O

Oh O
, O
but O
the O
mistress O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
the O
murder O
? O

Hillary O
I O
think O
-- O
yeah O
, O
cause O
he O
found O
out O
, O
they O
found O
out O
he O
had O
a O
mistress O
, O
and O
then O
it O
was O
like O
, O
oh O
-- O
Yeah O
. O

Are O
-- O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
so O
, O
but O
who O
knows O
? O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

Kelly O
Right O
. O

Hillary O
very O
sad O
cause O
she O
has O
a O
child O
herself O
and O
so O
she O
drug O
her O
son O
through O
a O
lot O
of O
-- O
uh O
, O
drama O
that O
he O
did O
n't O
need O
to O
be O
part O
of O
. O

Kelly O
Wait O
, O
what O
happened O
? O

Hillary O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

She O
has O
a O
son O
too O
, O
so O
he O
he O
also O
got O
put O
-- O
um O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
in O
the O
spotlight O
a O
bit O
, O
from O
what O
I O
understand O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
TV O
though O
, O
so O
I O
do O
n't O
really O
know O
. O

Kelly O
Oh O
, O
the O
son O
of O
the O
, O
right O
right O
. O

Hillary O
of O
-- O
of O
his O
girlfriend O
, O
yeah O
. O

Kelly O
Yeah O
. O

Hillary O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

I O
hear O
though O
, O
that O
he O
's O
going O
to O
be O
-- O
the O
first O
person O
to O
be O
( O
( O
) O
) O
um O
-- O
uh O
-- O
killed O
for O
a O
crime O
in O
California B-LOC
in O
like O
, O
thirty O
five O
years O
or O
something O
. O

Oh O
. O

Kelly O
Oh O
, O
really O
? O

Hillary O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
they O
've O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
they O
've O
-- O
um O
-- O
given O
him O
the O
death O
penalty O
yet O
. O

But O
I O
think O
he O
would O
be O
the O
first O
in O
, O
in O
a O
really O
long O
time O
to O
actually O
-- O
be O
killed O
. O

Kelly O
Yeah O
, O
that O
's O
amazing O
. O

Hillary O
I O
don't O
Kelly O
Um O
-- O
why O
, O
uh O
, O
now O
why O
did O
they O
decide O
that O
this O
was O
to O
be O
this O
big O
( O
( O
) O
) O
out O
of O
this O
with O
the O
most O
heinous O
crime O
in O
all O
of O
California B-LOC
? O

Hillary O
well O
, O
you O
know O
Kelly O
I O
mean O
I O
guess O
that O
's O
not O
how O
they O
decide O
who O
died O
, O
but O
it O
's O
because O
of O
the O
Hillary O
you O
know O
, O
and O
Kelly O
the O
, O
uh O
, O
cou- O
, O
like O
the O
-- O
the O
court O
that O
they O
went O
to O
, O
like O
the O
area O
doesn't O
Hillary O
well O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
why O
they O
decided O
on O
this O
, O
I O
think O
it O
was O
because O
it O
was O
so O
public O
of O
a O
case O
. O

But O
they O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
Kelly O
Yeah O
. O

Hillary O
they O
have O
many O
many O
worse O
crimes O
going O
on O
in O
California B-LOC
, O
parents O
killing O
their O
children O
and O
everything O
, O
that O
you O
would O
think O
-- O
would O
would O
, O
um O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
be O
Kelly O
Hearing O
more O
. O

Hillary O
be O
more O
Kelly O
Stringent O
penalties O
, O
Hillary O
yeah O
, O
but O
they O
do O
n't O
, O
they O
ignore O
those O
because O
this O
one O
got O
on O
television O
, O
I O
guess O
. O

Kelly O
keep O
like O
-- O
uh O
, O
the O
jury O
from O
watching O
~TV O
and O
the O
media O
and O
stuff O
. O

But O
I O
guess O
now O
( O
( O
it O
's O
, O
uh O
) O
) O
-- O
pretty O
much O
impossible O
-- O
to O
do O
. O

Hillary O
I O
i O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

I O
never O
really O
got O
the O
whole O
-- O
watching O
it O
on O
~TV O
and O
and O
getting O
into O
the O
whole O
-- O
mystery O
of O
it O
because O
, O
in O
the O
end O
, O
the O
woman O
's O
dead O
and O
so O
is O
her O
child O
and O
-- O
and O
-- O
there O
's O
-- O
really O
no O
way O
of O
changing O
that O
I O
guess O
. O

Kelly O
Yeah O
, O
uh O
, O
I O
think O
it O
's O
kind O
of O
strange O
how O
it O
was O
so O
publicized O
. O

Like O
I O
'm O
just O
, O
seriously O
, O
like O
I O
do O
n't O
, O
like O
I O
try O
not O
to O
watch O
, O
like O
-- O
too O
much O
, O
like O
Hillary O
You O
ca O
n't O
help O
it O
sometimes O
. O

Kelly O
Yeah O
I O
know O
. O

But O
it O
just O
amazes O
me O
that O
, O
uh O
, O
I O
think O
it O
's O
ridiculous O
how O
publicized O
-- O
how O
much O
publicity O
it O
got O
because O
-- O
I O
mean O
there O
's O
like O
human O
rights O
violations O
going O
on O
all O
around O
the O
world O
. O

I O
mean O
there's O
like O
, O
genocide O
in O
Sudan B-LOC
right O
now O
but O
like O
, O
nobody O
talks O
about O
that O
. O

That O
's O
like O
( O
( O
) O
) O
Hillary O
Oh O
yeah O
and O
what O
's O
going O
on O
in O
, O
I O
know O
and O
people O
-- O
flock O
, O
flock O
to O
the O
store O
to O
buy O
all O
their O
-- O
all O
their O
foreign O
made O
goods O
and O
it O
's O
like O
what O
are O
you O
-- O
doing O
? O

Obviously O
they O
do O
n't O
really O
care O
about O
what's O
going O
on O
. O

They O
just O
like O
to O
hear O
the O
details O
. O

Maybe O
if O
they O
could O
hear O
the O
details O
about O
other O
things O
they O
would O
be O
more O
involved O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O

Kelly O
Um O
( O
( O
) O
) O
it O
's O
almost O
like O
, O
uh O
-- O
( O

but O
it O
just O
seems O
like O
they O
just O
make O
it O
into O
like O
, O
like O
a O
soap O
opera O
for O
people O
to O
watch O
, O
you O
know O
? O

Hillary O
Well O
you O
know O
, O
some O
people O
were O
glued O
to O
their O
~TVs O
for O
weeks O
, O
and O
it O
's O
just O
to O
disturbing O
that O
that O
would O
be O
their O

their O
main O
entertainment O
during O

Kelly O
Oh O
yeah O
, O
definitely O
. O

It O
's O
creepy O

Hillary O
Especially O
when O
there O

so O
many O

they O
could O
be O

We O

with O
, O
uh O
, O
the O
death O
penalty O
or O
are O
they O
-- O
-- O
or O
are O
they O
going O
to O
be O
content O
with O
just O
, O
uh O
, O
just O
, O
you O
know O
, O
giving O
him O
life O
, O
uh O
, O
have O
heard O
about O
that O
? O

B O
Um O
, O
A O
I O
mean O
, O
are O
are O
they O
still O
going O
to O
go O
after O
him O
with O
al- O
with O
all O
their O
-- O
all O
of O
their O
ability O
? O

Eh O
, O
you O
know O
, O
are O
they O
-- O
are O
they O
s- O
B O
I O
think O
if O
they O
do O
-- O
if O
they O
-- O
th- O
I O
think O
that O
they O
can O
-- O
because O
-- O
in O
California B-LOC
, O
uh O
, O
the O
baby O
was O
considered O
a O
person O
A O
Yeah O
, O
yeah O
. O

So O
, O
th- O
then O
an- O
B O
and O
they O
had O
a O
little O
bit O
about O
that O
at O
church O
last O
week O
-- O
when O
I O
went O
to O
church O
services O
, O
or O
the O
week O
before O
, O
I O
ca O
n't O
remember O
, O
but O
, O
um O
, O
it O
-- O
I O
kind O
of O
thought O
then O
-- O
that O
, O
uh O
, O
when O
I O
first O
heard O
about O
the O
case O
, O
let O
me O
just O
back O
up O
a O
little O
bit O
. O

A O
Yeah O
. O

B O
When O
I O
first O
-- O
heard O
the O
case O
, O
or O
about O
it O
, O
I O
-- O
told O
myself O
, O
if O
he O
did O
do O
it O
, O
A O
Yeah O
, O
he O
probably O
did O
. O

B O
and O
I O
think O
he O
did O
, O
A O
Yeah O
. O

B O
uh O
, O
if O
he O
did O
do O
it O
, O
I O
-- O
thought O
to O
myself O
, O
he O
will O
probably O
get O
-- O
the O
maximum O
sentence O
of O
whatever O
it O
is O
A O
Well O
, O
he O
he O
he O
probably O
will O
, O
yeah O
. O

B O
because O
of O
the O
baby O
A O
Yeah O
. O

B O
and O
, O
to O
me O
, O
I O
-- O
do O
n't O
believe O
even O
-- O
eh O
, O
exactly O
, O
you O
know O
, O
fetal O
state O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
that O
was O
a O
baby O
-- O
that O
could O
've O
lived O
. O

A O
Right O
, O
a O
human O
being O
, O
yeah O
. O

B O
So O
, O
to O
me O
, O
I O
would O
n't O
-- O
he- O
it O
wouldn't O
've O
been O
good O
if O
he O
-- O
if O
I O
had O
been O
on O
his O
jury O
. O

A O
Mm O
, O
yeah O
, O
I O
see O
what O
you O
mean O
. O

B O
I O
could O
never O
vote O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
to O
let O
him O
go O
. O

A O
Well O
, O
you O
know O
B O
I O
c- O
but O
, O
now O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
that O
I O
would O
vote O
for O
a O
death O
penalty O
because O
I O
'm O
not O
sure O
that O
a O
-- O
a O
death O
cancels O
out O
a O
death O
. O

A O
Right O
, O
yeah O
. O

B O
I O
'm O
not O
-- O
-- O
I O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
and O
-- O
I O
would O
n't O
really O
be O
able O
to O
vote O
-- O
on O
that O
because O
my O
father O
was O
killed O
at O
work O
. O

A O
Oh O
, O
I O
'm O
sorry O
to O
hear O
that O
. O

B O
So O
, O
you O
think O
you O
-- O
-- O
so O
, O
you O
know O
, O
I O
I O
've O
got O
two O
things O
that O
probably O
-- O
I O
would O
be O
disqualified O
on O
that O
kind O
of O
a O
jury O
. O

A O
Yeah O
, O
maybe O
so O
. O

B O
Well O
, O
I O
'm O
pretty O
sure O
of O
it O
. O

A O
Well O
, O
uh- O
B O
But O
, O
uh O
, O
believe O
it O
or O
not O
, O
I O
do O
still O
feel O
sorry O
for O
him O
A O
Uh O
, O
wh- O
yeah O
, O
I O
do O
too O
. O

I O
feel O
sorry O
for O
him O
. O

B O
because O
, O
uh O
, O
A O
He O
's O
going O
to O
be O
in O
the O
B O
more O
so O
for O
his O
family O
-- O
m- O
more O
so O
for O
both O
families O
-- O
because O
I O
know O
that O
from O
my O
own O
experience O
, O
we O
're O
the O
one O
's O
that O
are O
left O
. O

A O
Well O
, O
he O
's O
also O
being O
, O
uh O
, O
you O
know O
, O
dragged O
through O
, O
uh O
, O
the O
media O
, O
you O
know O
, O
uh O
, O
B O
Now O
, O
to O
to O
me O
that O
was O
A O
the O
nation-wi- O
nation-wide O
med- O
the O
natio- O
B O
totally O
unfair O
. O

A O
Oh O
, O
you O
mean O
being O
dragged O
through O
the O
media O
like O
that O
? O

Yeah O
, O
it O
it O
is O
unfair O
, O
yeah O
. O

B O
Yeah O
. O

That O
was O
wrong O
. O

A O
You O
know O
, O
he O
's O
having O
th- O
he O
's O
having O
th- O
B O
Eh O
, O
I O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
though O
, O
if O
it O
was O
because O
it O
was O
sensational O
lies O
. O

The O
case O
was O
so O
different O
A O
W- O
well O
it O
was O
a- O
B O
and O
horrible O
. O

A O
it O
was O
a O
pretty O
sensational O
case O
, O
all O
right O
, O
yeah O
. O

B O
And O
then O
when O
they O
drug O
in O
, O
I O
re- O
I O
ca O
n't O
-- O
that O
Amber O
Frey O

and O
then O

I O
'm O
in O

Gloria O

any O
time O

bring O
in O
Amb- O
er O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
Allred O
, O
I O
'm O
not O
against O
her O
, O
I O
like O
her O
, O
eh O
, O
at O
times O
, O
but O
-- O
when O
they O
brought O
her O
in O
-- O
and O
this O
other O
woman O
, O
I O
though O
, O
uh-oh O
, O
any O
chance O
he O
has O
of O
any O
-- O
of O
any O
kind O
of O
a O
trial O
that O
's O
, O
uh O
, O
not O
what O
I O
call O
sensationalized O
, O
is O
over O
. O

A O
Well O
, O
yeah O
. O

Uh O
, O
I O
agree O
with O
that O
, O
yeah O
. O

B O
Over O
. O

Forge- O
A O
You O
know O
, O
she O
was O
, O
eh O
, O
in O
-- O
always O
ruling O
in O
, O
uh O
, O
in O
, O
uh O
, O
what O
was O
the O
word O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
, O
uh O
, O
possessive O
-- O
no O
, O
not O
possessive O
but O
protective O
-- O
of O
, O
um O
, O
of O
, O
uh O
, O
her O
client O
, O
um O
, O
just O
, O
um O
, O
wh- O
what O
was O
her O
name O
? O

B O
Amber O
? O

The- O
the O
girl O
? O

A O
Yeah O
. O

He O
was O
o- O
yeah O
. O

She O
was O
always O
ready O
to O
bite O
anyone O
's O
head O
off O
that O
ha- O
had O
anything O
, O
you O
know O
, O
slightly O
wrong O
abo- O
you O
know O
, O
uh O
, O
ow O
, O
or O
amiss O
about O
Amber O
. O

B O
Well O
, O
you O
know O
, O
you O
may O
think O
I O
'm O
a O
little O
-- O
crazy O
, O
but O
at O
first O
when O
I O
heard O
about O
, O
uh O
, O
Frey O
, O
when O
I O
first O
heard O
about O
her O
, O
I O
got O
worried O
that O
maybe O
it O
was O
-- O
both O
of O
them O
A O
No O
, O
yeah O
, O
may- O
B O
because O
they O
're O
-- O
I O
've O
never O
totally O
-- O
believed O
-- O
that O
Peterson O
did O
this O
all O
by O
himself O
. O

A O
She O
may O
have O
-- O
she O
may O
have O
, O
uh O
, O
planted O
the O
idea O
in O
his O
head O
, O
you O
know O
. O

B O
Yet O
something O
tells O
me O
, O
and O
-- O
I O
think O
-- O
that O
he O
actually O
-- O
was O
so O
involved O
her O
, O
th- O
Amber O
, O
A O
Yeah O
. O

B O
that O
if O
-- O
she O
had O
anything O
to O
do O
with O
this O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
he O
would O
ever O
tell O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
believe O
he O
would O
ever O
tell O
on O
her O
. O

A O
Yeah O
. O

Uh O
B O
There O
was O
the O
impression O
I O
got O
. O

I O
kind O
of O
, O
uh O
, O
watched O
him O
at O
different O
times O
when O
they O
would O
mention O
her O
A O
Yeah O
, O
he O
he O
seemed O
to O
be O
be O
very O
vili- O
he O
seemed O
to O
be O
most O
most O
un- O
at- O
eh O
, O
un-at-ease O
B O
and O
I O
just O
think O
that O
A O
when O
they O
were O
talking O
about O
Amber O
. O

B O
Right O
. O

A O
Yeah O
. O

Uh O
B O
And O
that O
caught O
my O
eye O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
it O
's O
because O
I O
'm O
a O
woman O
but O
, O
um O
, O
I O
thought O
, O
uh-oh O
, O
A O
Hm O
. O

B O
because O
at O
that O
time O
, O
uh O
-- O
right O
now O
, O
I O
've O
been O
, O
like O
, O
totally O
busy O
with O
, O
uh O
, O
holiday O

, O
what O
were O
his O
motives O
? O

How O
closely O
did O
you O
follow O
the O
trial O
and O
what O
do O
you O
think O
of O
all O
of O
the O
media O
coverage O
of O
the O
trial O
? O

What O
kind O
of O

should O
Peterson O

name O
is O
Jean O
, O
and O

in O
Arizona B-LOC
. O

Mohammed O
Oh O
, O
from O
Arizona B-LOC
, O
Jean O
. O

How O
are O
you O
doing O
? O

Jean O
I O
'm O
fine O
, O
thank O
you O
. O

And O
what O
's O
your O
name O
? O

Mohammed O
Ah O
, O
this O
is O
Mohammed O
, O
calling O
from O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
. O

Jean O
Mohammed O
, O
calling O
from O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
. O

Glad O
to O
meet O
you O
. O

Well O
, O
the O
topic O
is O
interesting O
, O
but O
they O
've O
been O
having O
this O
one O
for O
three O
days O
. O

I O
don't O
know O
why O
they O
're O
so O
obsessed O
with O
it O
. O

Mohammed O
Seems O
like O
it O
's O
a O
weekend O
, O
or O
they O
want O
to O
get O
as O
much O
as O
they O
can O
feedback O
from O
people O
. O

Jean O
I O
guess O
so O
, O
Yes O
. O

Mohammed O
And O
so O
what O
do O
you O
think O
was- O
Jean O
I O
I O
did O
n't O
actually O
-- O
watch O
the O
trial O
very O
much O
, O
uh O
th- O
in O
fact O
, O
I O
did O
n't O
watch O
the O
trial O
at O
all O
. O

Mohammed O
Mhm O
. O

Jean O
I O
read O
about O
it O
in O
the O
newspaper O
and O
things O
like O
that O
. O

Um O
, O
I O
do O
think O
from O
all O
the O
, O
uh O
, O
things O
that O
I O
have O
heard O
that O
he O
-- O
had O
to O
be O
guilty O
with O
all O
the O
evidence O
that O
they O
had O
, O
but O
um O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
really O
know O
why O
, O
uh O
, O
if O
everybody O
was O
so O
, O
sort O
of O
, O
obsessed O
about O
it O
when O
we O
've O
got O
so O
much O
other O
-- O
things O
going O
on O
in O
the O
world O
that O
, O
uh O
, O
seem O
to O
me O
much O
more O
important O
, O
but O
um O
. O

Perhaps O
it O
was O
because O
he O
seemed O
, O
uh O
, O
a O
very O
human O
kind O
of O
person O
and O
, O
and O
you O
cou- O
you O
could O
n't O
really O
understand O
why O
he O
would O
want O
to O
do O
something O
about O
that O
. O

I- O
I O
think O
his O
motive O
must O
have O
been O
to O
be O
with O
his O
new O
girlfriend O
, O
but O
uh- O
-- O
kill O
his O
own O
first O
child O
that O
way O
is O
extraordinary O
. O

What O
do O
you O
think O
? O

Mohamed O
? O

Mohammed O
Yeah O
. O

Jean O
And O
what O
do O
you- O
What O
do O
you O
think O
about O
it O
? O

Mohammed O
Being O
very O
frankly O
, O
I O
was O
not O
, O
uh O
, O
following O
the O
case O
at O
all O
even O
uh O
uh O
television O
, O
or O
uh O
reading O
, O
but O
from O
what O
I O
can O
observe O
, O
that O
it O
seems O
, O
eh O
, O
it O
has O
been O
talking O
-- O
-- O
taking O
too O
long O
time O
. O

Like O
one O
year O
almost O
, O
now O
. O

It O
was- O
Jean O
When O
you O
what O
? O

Mohammed O
It O
was O
-- O
taking O
so O
much O
time O
. O

Long O
time O
. O

Jean O
Yes O
. O

Mohammed O
The O
case O
is O
almost O
one O
year O
. O

Like O
last O
, O
uh O
, O
Christmas O
if O
I O
'm O
not O
, O
uh O
, O
recalling O
my O
memory O
. O

So O
for O
one O
year O
, O
it O
's O
really O
a O
good O
time O
. O

Hu- O
So O
I O
'm O
asking O
myself O
why O
it O
took O
such O
a O
long O
Jean O
Hm O
. O

Mohammed O
It O
may O
be O
because O
-- O
it O
's O
quite O
important O
, O
or O
so O
there O
is O
so O
many O
everything O
's O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
it O
's O
, O
it O
's O
a O
really O
different O
case O
. O

But O
, O
the O
quo- O
the O
nice O
quotient O
is O
about O
the O
media O
. O

But O
the O
media O
have O
biased O
in O
this O
, O
Jean O
Yes O
. O

Mohammed O
or O
not O
? O

I O
believe O
that O
media O
is O
a O
very O
good O
, O
uh O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
uh O
, O
way O
to O
give O
us O
all O
the O
opportunity O
to O
understand O
and O
see O
. O

I O
mean O
without O
the O
media O
, O
you O
and O
I O
, O
how O
we O
will O
be O
knowing O
? O

Jean O
No O
, O
exactly O
. O

Do O
you O
think O
they O
were O
biased O
in O
in O
-- O
favor O
of O
him O
, O
or O
in O
favor O
Mohammed O
I- O
-- O
No O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
so O
. O

Jean O
No O
, O
I O
did O
n't O
think O
so O
either O
from O
what O
I O
heard O
. O

Mohammed O
Maybe O
-- O
sometimes O
in- O
in- O
in- O
in O
other O
issues O
they- O
they O
may O
be O
biased O
, O
but O
in O
this O
issue O
they O
were O
just O
-- O
covering O
what O
's O
happening O
, O
Jean O
Yes O
. O

Mohammed O
and O
, O
uh O
, O
they O
give O
us O
the O
picture O
. O

It O
was O
a O
camera O
-- O
to O
give O
you O
the O
view O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
they O
were O
biased O
in O
this O
case O
here O
. O

Jean O
Yes O
. O

No O
. O

Mohammed O
And O
, O
uh O
, O
what O
do O
you O
think O
will O
happen O
next O
? O

Jean O
Well O
, O
uh O
they O
're O
coming O
up O
to O
the O
sentencing O
, O
and O
I O
heard O
yesterday O
or O
read O
in O
the O
newspaper O
or O
something O
that O
his O
brother O
-- O
I O
guess O
it O
was O
on O
the O
television O
. O

In O
the O
news O
, O
his O
brother O
was O
appealing O
-- O
for O
them O
to O
to O
sentence O
him O
to O
-- O
to O
prison O
for O
life O
rather O
than O
the O
death O
penalty O
, O
because O
-- O
he O
said O
he O
's O
a O
very O
good O
listener O
and O
he O
cares O
about O
people O
, O
and O
and O
he O
might O
be O
able O
to O
help O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
in O
prison O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
whether O
that O
is O
true O
or O
not O
. O

I O
know O
that O
he O
had O
done O
a O
lot O
of O
volunteer O
things O
before O
, O
and O
that O
was O
the O
one O
things O
that O
made O
me O
wonder O
there O
was O
any O
possible O
chance O
that O
it O
could O
have O
been O
somebody O
else O
who O
did O
it O
. O

I O
think O
given O
such O
as O
I O
have O
heard O
, O
even O
though O
like O
you O
, O
I O
did O
not O
follow O
the O
case O
day O
by O
day O
or O
anything O
like O
that O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
quite O
see O
how O
he O
could O
not O
be O
guilty O
if O
they O
've O
got O
so O
much O
that O
appears O
to O
point O
to O
him O
. O

And O
what O
would O
be O
the O
motive O
for O
anybody O
trying O
to O
-- O
to O
get O
him O
if O
it O
wasn't O

) O
Controversial O
PLO B-ORG
leader O
Yasser O
Arafat O
died O
in O
a O
Paris B-LOC
hospital O
last O

. O

Do O
you O
think O
Arafat O
's O
death O
will O
help O
or O
hurt O
the O
Israeli-Palestinian B-LOC
peace O
process O
? O

Was O
Arafat O
a O
good O
leader O
? O

What O
do O
you O
think O
US B-LOC
policy O
should O
be O
toward O
Palestine B-LOC
now O
that O
Arafat O
has O
died O
? O

What O
, O
if O
anything O
, O
should O
the O

Gandhi O
Hi O
, O
good O
evening O
. O

Marco O
Hi O
. O

Wha- O
I O
did O
n't O
catch O
your O
name O
. O

What O
's O
your O
name O
? O

Gandhi O
Gandhi O
from O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
. O

You O
? O

Marco O
Gindhi O
? O

Gandhi O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
. O

Yeah O
. O

Marco O
From O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
. O

Gandhi O
Yeah O
. O

Marco O
Uh O
, O
Marco O
from O
Illinois B-LOC
. O

Gandhi O
Okay O
, O
Mark O
. O

Uh O
, O
I O
think O
it O
's O
fresh O
topic O
for O
tonight O
. O

Marco O
Yeah O
, O
yeah O
. O

Good O
topic O
. O

It O
's O
a O
good O
topic O
. O

Gandhi O
So O
what O
do O
you O
think O
? O

Marco O
Well O
, O
um O
, O
I O
would- O
I O
would O
have O
to O
start- O
-- O
I O
would O
have O
to O
start O
, O
generally O
, O
in O
stating- O
-- O
stating O
what O
I O
think O
is O
the O
problem O
and O
-- O
-with O
the O
Middle B-LOC
East I-LOC
and O
what- O
For O
me O
, O
one O
of O
the O
major O
problems O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
-- O
the O
-- O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
government O
gives O
so O
much O
aid O
to O
the O
state O
of O
Israel B-LOC
. O

In O
which O
, O
the O
state O
of O
Israel B-LOC
buys O
-- O
many O
expensive O
military O
weapons O
, O
ah O
, O
which O
is O
used O
to O
-- O
oppress O
and O
-- O
to O
kill O
a O
lot O
of O
Palestinians O
. O

So O
, O
for O
me O
, O
that O
's O
-- O
the- O
that O
's O
essentially O
the O
root O
of O
the O
problem O
. O

And O
, O
um O
, O
Yasser O
Arafat O
was O
kind O
of O
in O
a O
difficult O
position O
, O
because O
you O
have O
these O
, O
um O
, O
incredibly O
-- O
oppressed O
and O
in O
some O
ways O
imprisoned O
, O
uh O
, O
Palestinians O
, O
and O
if O
-- O
Arafat O
had O
n't O
, O
um O
, O
tried O
to O
stand O
up O
-- O
and O
help O
them O
and- O
and O
fight O
for O
their O
rights O
, O
then O
-- O
m- O
they O
would O
n't O
have O
respected O
Arafat O
, O
but O
then O
again O
, O
you O
know O
, O
he O
could O
n't O
be O
too O
friendly O
with O
the O
West B-LOC
, O
um O
, O
and O
, O
um O
, O
and O
so O
he O
did O
the O
best O
he O
could O
, O
I O
think O
. O

It O
's O
a O
difficult O
-- O
leadership O
role O
. O

Gandhi O
Mhm O
. O

Marco O
Yeah O
. O

Um O
, O
what O
do- O
Well O
, O
how O
about O
you O
? O

Gandhi O
I O
think O
, O
yeah O
, O
more O
or O
less O
, O
I O
c- O
I O
agree O
with O
what O
you O
said O
. O

It's O
almost O
, O
this O
is O
my O
view O
as O
well O
. O

And O
the O
question O
is O
, O
what O
next O
? O

I O
mean O
, O
some O
idea O
-- O
from O
Israeli B-LOC
side O
, O
they O
were O
saying O
-- O
he O
was O
a O
problem O
, O
and O
if O
he O
goes O
, O
everything O
will O
be O
quite O
easy O
. O

Marco O
Yeah O
. O

Gandhi O
Fine O
. O

Now O
he O
's O
not O
in O
anymore O
. O

Marco O
Yeah O
. O

Gandhi O
So O
, O
let O
us O
wait O
and O
see O
. O

Hope O
. O

If O
he O
was O
a O
problem O
himself O
, O
hope O
-uh O
, O
the O
coming O
one O
-- O
will O
be O
in O
a O
good O
-- O
position O
to O
negotiate O
with O
the O
other O
side O
, O
Israel B-LOC
, O
and O
then O
-- O
peace O
can O
be O
achieved O
. O

Marco O
Yeah O
. O

Gandhi O
Uh O
, O
we O
have O
to O
wait O
and O
see O
, O
but O
, O
uh O
, O
it O
seems O
it O
's O
not O
easy O
. O

Marco O
But O
, O
I O
, O
eh O
, O
I O
get O
the O
feeling O
that- O
-- O
It O
's O
almost- O
-- O
The O
peace O
process- O
We O
ca O
n't O
put O
it O
on O
-- O
the O
ro- O
or O
the- O
-- O
the O
whole O
responsibility O
of O
the O
pre- O
-- O
peace O
process O
ca O
n't O
be O
the O
leader O
of O
-- O
a- O
-- O
a O
group O
that O
is- O
-- O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
in O
my O
view O
, O
has O
-- O
not O
ver- O
not O
very O
many O
resources O
to O
fight- O
-- O
to O
fight O
this O
-- O
battle O
that O
-- O
their O
trying O
to O
fight O
against O
-- O
a O
government O
that O
has O
taken O
away O
a O
lot O
of O
their O
land O
, O
that O
, O
you O
know O
, O
does O
n't O
allow O
them O
to O
really O
move O
around O
in O
their O
own O
country O
. O

So O
, O
unless O
that O
-- O
stops O
, O
the O
, O
um O
, O
the O
leader O
of O
the O
Palestinians O
-- O
really O
ca O
n't O
do O
too O
much O
-- O
to O
further O
the O
peace O
process O
, O
because O
-- O
there O
are O
-- O
a O
lot O
of O
bad O
things O
happening O
to O
the O
people O
-- O
of O
that O
-- O
leader O
. O

Gandhi O
That O
's O
correct O
, O
as O
well O
. O

Marco O
Yeah O
, O
so O
it's- O
-- O
it O
's O
kind O
of O
, O
it's- O
-- O
it O
seems O
like O
the O
, O
um O
, O
the O
media O
, O
at O
least O
in O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
, O
is O
-- O
putting O
all O
of O
this O
-- O
focus O
and O
responsibility O
on O
the O
leader O
of O
the O
Palestinians O
, O
as O
if O
it O
was O
Gandhi O
Marco O
Arafat O
's O
fault O
that O
any O
of- O
-- O
any O
of O
the O
violence O
was O
caused O
. O

So O
, O
it O
seems O
like O
an O
unfair O
treatment O
-- O
of- O
-- O
of O
, O
you O
know O
, O
the O
leader O
of O
-- O
the O
Palestinian B-LOC
people O
. O

Um O
, O
yeah O
. O

Gandhi O
Yes O
. O

That O
's O
absolutely O
correct O
. O

Yeah O
. O

Marco O
Yeah O
. O

Hm O
. O

Gandhi O
Actually O
, O
it- O
it O
's O
a O
good O
topic O
to O
be O
choosing O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
uh O
, O
because O
it O
's O
one O
of O
the O
fresh O
topics O
. O

Marco O
Yeah O
. O

Gandhi O
How O
long O
have O
you O
been O
with O
the O
study O
? O

Marco O
Uh O
, O
this O
is O
probably O
my O
tenth O
or O
eleventh O
conversation O
. O

Gandhi O
Tenth O
, O
eleven O
. O

Almost O
the O
same O
like O
me O
. O

So O
, O
the O
other O
-- O
days O
, O
which O
one O
was O
quite O
interesting O
to O
you O
? O

Marco O
Um O
, O
well O
, O
there O
's O
been O
a O
couple O
where O
-- O
they've- O
they O
talked O
about O
the O
Cabinet O
-- O
for O
-- O
Bush O
, O
and O
Bush O
has O
been O
, O
um O
, O
you O
know O
, O
selecting O
new O
Cabinet O
members O
and O
-- O
all O
of O
the O
new O
members O
are O
people O
that O
I'm- O
I O
do O
n't O
really O
know O
very O
well O
. O

So O
, O
there O
's O
been O
some O
topics O
where O
I'm- O
I O
did O
n't O
have O
very O
much O
information O
. O

Other O
topics O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
usually O
about O
the O
election O
that- O
-- O
that O
, O
um O
, O
I O
did O
have O
-- O
a O
lot O
of O
things O
, O
um O
, O
to O
say O
. O

Yeah O

Are O
you- O

are O

he O

he O
did O

Ben O

, O
there O
was O
a O
show O
here O
in O
New B-LOC

at O
a O
big O

I O

maybe O
it O
was O
at O

in O
the O

or O
the O
Metropolitan O
Opera O
House O
or O
the O

also O
in O

his O
, O
uh O
, O
comment O
to O
the O
press O
afterwards O
was O
that O
, O
you O
know O

he O
just O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
honor O
a O

, O
and O
I O
-- O
one O
of O
the O
few O
things O
that O
I O
was O
happy O
about O

he O

Sue O
Mhm O

I O

I O
kind O

though O

I O
-- O

I O
do O

he O
accomplished O

the O

he O
did O
but O
I O
think O
he O
really O
failed O
miserably O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
when O
he O
, O
um O
, O
refused O
to O
sign O
that O
treaty O
that O
was O
originally O
set O
up O
because O
it O
was O
a O
wonderful O
-- O
option O
and O
it O
really O
could O
've O
re- O
done O
some O
wonderful O
things O
for O
his O
people O
and O
I O
think O
he O
really O
did O
them O
a O
disservice O
by O
not O
taking O
care O
of O
it O
at O
that O
time O
. O

Ben O
Uh-huh O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Yeah O
, O
what O
was O
the O
treaty O
? O

I O
'm O
not O
familiar O
with O
it O
. O

Sue O
Well O
, O
um O
, O
where O
they O
were O
going O
to O
, O
uh O
, O
give O
them O
, O
like O
, O
ninety-six O
percent O
of O
the O
Ga- O
of- O
of O
Gaza B-LOC
and O
he O
said O
that O
he O
wanted O
all O
hundred O
percent O
. O

And O
so O
he O
refused O
to O
sign O
it O
. O

It O
was O
just O
an- O
an O
incredible O
faux O
pas O
on O
his O
part O
, O
from O
my O
opinion O
. O

Ben O
Oh O
. O

Yeah O
. O

Yeah O
, O
y- O
it's- O
it O
's O
-- O
you O
have O
to O
sometimes O
take O
a O
little O
bit O
less O
than O
you O
want O
, O
you O
know O
, O
uh O
, O
an- O
and O
ninety-six O
percent O
is O
a O
big O
percentage O
, O
you O
know O
. O

Sue O
Yes O
. O

And O
I O
think O
that O
could O
have O
really O
done O
some O
wonderful O
uh O
steps O
for O
-- O
uh O
for O
the O
Palestinian B-LOC
people O
uh O
as O
a O
whole O
. O

And O
I O
felt O
-- O
very O
sad O
that O
, O
um O
, O
that O
that O
was O
n't O
-- O
done O
. O

It O
really O
should O
've O
been O
. O

Um O
, O
it O
was O
really O
quite O
unfortunate O
that- O
that O
he O
-- O
that O
he O
was O
not O
willing O
to O
, O
um O
, O
step O
forward O
-- O
to O
do- O
do O
what O
was O
really O
in O
the O
best O
interests O
of O
his O
people O
. O

Ben O
Sometimes- O
sometimes O
I O
th- O
I O
think O
it O
's O
hard O
when- O
when O
you O
're O
the- O
the O
first O
leader O
, O
or O
the O
George O
Washington O
of O
something O
, O
to O
see O
things O
other O
than O
in O
black O
and O
white O
. O

You O
know O
, O
or O
maybe O
he O
did O
n't O
have O
the O
gift O
of- O
of O
nuance O
that O
would O
've O
helped O
him O
to- O
-- O
to O
take O
that O
right O
step O
, O
uh O
, O
you O
know O
, O
the- O
-- O
the O
-- O
his O
people O
suffer O
so O
terribly O
and O
maybe O
, O
you O
know O
, O
it O
could O
have O
been O
better O
if O
he O
had O
signed O
that O
, O
huh O
. O

Sue O
I O
really O
think O
so O
. O

I O
really O
, O
truly O
do O
and O
now O
it O
's O
a- O
a O
situation O
where O
, O
with O
his O
passing O
, O
um O
, O
I O
think O
there O
's O
a O
real O
, O
um O
, O
new O
opening O
, O
a O
new O
possibility O
for- O
-- O
some O
extremely O
positive O
steps O
to O
come O
forward O
out O
of O
this O
-- O
I O
do O
think O
that O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
-- O
will O
probably O
be O
requested O
to O
be O
involved O
in O
the O
negotiation O

and O
I O
understand O
that O
, O
I O
me- O
uh O
, O
because O
, O
um O
, O
I O
think O

both O
sides O
-- O
have O
a O
trust O
in O
the O
United B-LOC

that O
make O
it- O

we O

Ben O
arm-twisting O

And O
stuff O
, O
and O
uh O
-- O
That O
's O
why O
we O
should O
be O
there O
but O
I O
'm O
I O
'm O
kind O
of O
scared O
of O
the O
people O

that O
represent O
the O
United B-LOC

now O
, O
you O
know O

They O
're O
not O
quite O
the O

Sue O
Well O

that O
's O
really O
true O

but O
it- O

we O

, O
I O
bet O
he O
was O
n't O
a O
really O
good O
leader O
. O

I O
think O
that O
, O
um O
, O
that O
his O
situation O
-- O
-- O
well O
, O
see O
I O
got O
to O
the O
-- O
to- O
to O
the O
level O
of O
power O
that O
he O
was O
in O
-- O
back O
in O
the O
eighties O
-- O
and O
once O
he O
, O
um O
, O
you O
know O
, O
started O
getting O
wealthy O
and O
started O
getting O
known O
, O
that O
his O
agenda O
ch- O
uh O
, O
changed O
Barb O
Mhm O
. O

Roger O
but O
it O
was O
n't O
actually O
for O
peace O
but O
was O
to O
try O
to O
find O
a O
way O
to O
( O
( O
send O
) O
) O
the O
Israelis O
out O
of O
Jerusalem B-LOC
in O
the O
areas O
that O
they O
wanted O
. O

I O
really O
do O
n't O
think O
that O
-- O
they O
wanted O
to O
coexist O
. O

I O
think O
that O
, O
um O
, O
he O
wanted O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
all O
his O
people O
-- O
all O
his O
people O
wanted O
to O
coexist O
with O
the O
-- O
Israelis O
. O

I O
think O
that O
, O
um O
, O
his O
death O
-- O
marks O
a O
beginning O
of O
trying O
to O
find O
somebody O
that O
-- O
really O
wants O
peace O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
that O
in O
that O
area O
of O
the O
, O
um O
, O
world O
that O
you O
could O
actually O
have O
peace O
. O

If O
you O
know O
the O
Bible O
well O
you O
would O
know O
that O
there O
's O
always O
going O
to O
be O
a O
conflict O
there O
. O

Um O
, O
I O
think O
that O
, O
uh O
, O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
should O
open O
up O
-- O
their O
-- O
doors O
to O
-- O
not O
help O

but O
support O
any O
, O
um O
, O
process O
for O
peace O
in O
the O
area O
, O
though O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
that O
we O
should O
get O
involved O
to O
a O
level O
, O
a O
point O
where O
we O
're O
sending O
people O
over O
there O
and O
, O
um O
, O
trying O
to O
-- O
help O
keep O
the O
peace O
or O
anything O
like O
that O
, O
um O
. O

There O
's O
a O
lot O
of O
stuff O
that O
can O
be O
done O
-- O
by O
just O
verbal O
suppo- O
-- O
you O
know O
. O

I O
think O
that O
now O
he O
's O
gone O
, O
his O
family O
is O
still O
around O
, O
and O
Barb O
Yeah O
. O

Roger O
uh O
, O
millions O
and O
millions O
of O
dollars O
that O
he O
had O
is O
still O
around O
but O
they O
-- O
if O
they O
bring O
people O
in O
that O
was O
n't O
involved O
with O
his O
cabinet O
, O
n- O
um O
, O
have O
different O
views O
than O
him O
, O
somebody O
that O
gener- O
genuinely O
can O
accept O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
Israel- O
-- O
Is- O
Israelis O
are O
there O
and O
they O
're O
there O
to O
stay O
-- O
and O
, O
um O
, O
we O
going O
to O
have O
to O
find O
a O
way O
to O
coexist O
. O

If O
they O
can O
find O
somebody O
like O
that O
, O
then O
I O
think O
that O
they O
should O
f- O
support O
him O
and O
, O
um O
, O
and O
back O
him O
up O
-- O
in O
trying O
to O
help O
define O
-- O
peace O
in O
the O
area O
where O
peace O
is O
impossible O
. O

What O
do O
you O
think O
about O
it O
? O

Barb O
I O
agree O
with O
you O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
know O
that O
much O
about O
it O
, O
I O
was O
n't O
much O
into O
politics O
back O
in O
the O
eighties O
. O

I O
was O
more O
, O
um O
, O
kind O
of O
a O
-- O
I O
was O
a O
kid O
on O

run O
from O
abusive O
parents O
back O
then O
so O
that O
was O
n't O

you O

one O
of O
my O
topics O

at O

Um O
, O
I O
-- O
my O
roommate O

and O
I O
still O
do O
n't O
know O
that O
much O
about O
-- O
I O
'd O
love O
to O
know O
more O
about O
politics O
and O
I O
'm O
trying O
to O
learn O
more O
, O
uh O
, O
tells O
me O
, O
you O
know O
, O
he O
was O
such O
a O
terrible O
man O
but O
, O
eh O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
listen O
to O
everything O
he O
says O
. O

And O
I O
think O
it O
-- O
-- O
I O
mean O
, O
it O
would O
be O
nice O
to O
have O
peace O
over O
there O
, O
but O
I O
agree O
with O
you O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
's O
ever O
going O
to O
happen O
. O

I O
mean O
, O
not O
the O
way O
-- O
-- O
not O
the O
way O
they O
'll O
-- O
-- O
not O
like O
it O
is O
here O
. O

And O
I O
agree O
that O
we O
should O
n't O
send O
people O
over O
there O
. O

We O
've O
got O
enough O
stuff O
going O
on O
with O
Roger O

Barb O
Iraq B-LOC

other O

Barb O
We O

we O
we O
ca O
n't O

Roger O

Barb O
that O
would O
be O
just O
putting O
it O

I O

support O

you O

a O
man O
that O
, O
Roger O
Mhm O
. O

Barb O
like O
you O
said O

would O
like O
to O

with O
everybody O
and O
somebody O
that O
is O
Roger O

Barb O
peaceful O
-- O
and O
, O
I O
do O
n't O

, O
I O
'd O
like O
to O
learn O
more O
about O
the O
Bible O

My O
parents O
never O
took O
me O
to O

anything O
. O

But O
, O
um O
, O
Roger O
Yeah O
. O

Barb O
I O
'd O
like O
to O
-- O
I O
know O
that O
, O
you O
know O
, O
there O
's O
been O
problems O
, O
a O
lot O
of O
conflict O
over O

and O
it O
seems O
like O
no O

what O
, O
Roger O
Ah O
. O

Barb O
just O
like O
Iraq B-LOC
ye- O
eh O
, O
we O
try O
to O
go O
in O
and O
get O
peace O
and- O
and O
how O
long O
has O
it O
been O
and O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
I O
think O
Saddam O
needed O
to O
be O
removed O
but O
it's- O
-- O
there O
's O
just O
-- O
s- O
all O
these O
people O
that O
are O
going O

him O
no O

what O

Roger O
Yeah O
, O
and O
, O
um O
, O
I O
only O
know O
about O
Yasser O
Arafat O
because O
I O
, O
um O
, O
study O
international O
affairs O
a O
little O
bit O
-- O
and O
I O
know O
-- O
a O
very O
little O
bit O
about O
him O
because O
, O
of O
course O
he O
was O
a O
, O
um O
, O
leader O
for O
a O
long O
time O
, O
longer O
than O
the O
age O
that O
I O
am O
-- O
old O
, O
so O
, O
but O
I- O
I- O
I- O
I O
've O
noticed O
-- O
on O
throughout O
my O
studies O
that O
-- O
what O
he O
represented O
to O
the O
public O
-- O
was O
-- O
what O
he O
represented O
to O
the O
international O
public O
-- O
was O
not O
what O
he O
was O
representing O
to O
his O
people O
-- O
and O
he O
was O
representing O
, O
um O
, O
peace O
with O
the O

he O
was O

trying O

that O

uh O

terrorists O
in O

But O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
that O
he O
had O
the O
same O
image O
to- O
to O
his O
people O
. O

I O
think O
that O
it O
was O
a O
front O

for O
him O
to O
allow O
to O
to O
be O
accepted O
in O
an O
international O
community O
, O
but O
I O
think O
-- O
that O
his O
ultimate O
plans O

goals O
were O
to O
to O
run O
the O

out O
-- O
maybe O
closer O

Ali O
Hi O

Mark O

name O

Mark O
. O

Ali O
My O
name O
is O
Ali O
, O
uh O
, O
Mark O
How O

Ali O

Pennsylvania B-LOC

I O
'm O
fine O
. O

How O
are O
you O
? O

Mark O
Good O
, O
good O
. O

Not O
too O
bad O
. O

Ali O
Uh O
, O
so O
let O
me O
ask O
you O
, O
do O
you O
think O
Arafat O
was O
, O
uh O
, O
a O
good O
leader O
or O
not O
? O

Mark O
Um O
, O
to O
hi- O
-- O
yeah O
, O
I- O
-- O
I O
think O
he O
did O
what O
he O
thought O
-- O
was O
right O
for O
his O
people O
. O

I- O
I- O
-- O
I O
would O
say O
he O
was O
a O
good O
leader O
-- O
for- O
-- O
for O
, O
uh O
, O
his O
people O
. O

And O
as O
far O
as O
our O
involvement O
there O
, O
should O
be O
as O
little O
as O
possible O
. O

Just O
let O
them O
do O
-- O
what O
they O
, O
you O
know O
, O
what O
they're O
going O
to O
do O
-- O
and O
we O
should O
stay O
out O
of O
it O
( O
( O
just O
) O
) O
as O
-- O
much O
as O
we O
can O
. O

Uh O
, O
this O
country O
seems O
to O
get O
involved O
too O
much O
in O
other O
people's O
politics O
. O

Should O
just O
let O
them O
do O
whatever O
they O
're O
going O
to O
do O
, O
Ali O
Uh O
, O
Mark O
you O
know O
. O

Ali O
mm O
, O
by O
the O
way O
I O
am O
from O
Arab O
origin O
, O
so O
I O
also O
have O
, O
uh O
, O
uh O
, O
the O
same O
opinion O
-- O
like O
you O
. O

I O
believe O
he O
-- O
-- O
in O
my O
opinion O
he- O
he O
was O
a O
good O
leader O
-- O
and O
, O
um O
, O
I O
believe O
what O
, O
eh O
, O
has O
to O
be O
done O
-- O
right O
now O
is O
to O
( O
( O
apply O
) O
) O
-- O
the O
United B-ORG
Nations I-ORG
' O
, O
uh O
, O
decisions O
about O
the O
conflict O
between O
Arab O
and O
Israel B-LOC
because O
there O
is O
-- O
-- O
there O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
, O
uh O
, O
decisions O
have O
been O
made O
-- O
have O
been O
made O
-- O
and O
this O
, O
uh- O
For O
example O
, O
one O
of O
them O
was O
, O
uh O
, O
decision O
number O
two O
forty-two O
-- O
and O
this O
was O
about O
-- O
the O
ha- O
establishing O
two- O
two O
countries O
, O
one O
for O
Israel B-LOC
and O
another O
one O
for O
Palestine B-LOC
. O

Mark O
Right O
. O

Ali O
So O
, O
if O
we O
-- O
-- O
eh O
, O
if O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
, O
Bush O
, O
Israel B-LOC
( O
( O
told O
) O
) O
th- O
the O
solution O
or O
to O
, O
uh O
, O
to O
make O
the O
decision O
, O
eh O
, O
I O
think O
this O
will O
solve O
-- O
the O
problem O
. O

The O
-- O
unfortunately O
what O
happens O
right O
now- O
-- O
The O
-- O
for O
example O
, O
which O
is O
-- O
little O
bit O
toward O
it's- O
it O
's O
interest O
. O

For O
example O
, O
when O
there O
was O
, O
uh O
, O
like O
, O
a O
-- O
decision O
against O
Iraq B-LOC
, O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
-- O
went O
directly O
-- O
to O
Iraq B-LOC
to O
-- O
-- O
for O
, O
eh O
, O
uh O
, O
an O
invasion O
-- O
and O
-- O
for O
-- O
whatever O
reasons- O
-- O
she O
even O
was O
out O
, O
uh O
, O
putting O
any O
attention O
to O
the O
United B-ORG
Nations I-ORG
, O
uh O
, O
like O
, O
uh O
, O
approval O
. O

She O
did O
wha- O
what O
she O
want O
. O

But O
, O
eh O
, O
eh O
, O
for O
Israeli B-LOC
, O
Palestinian B-LOC
conflict O
there O
's O
a O
lot O
of O
decisions O
that O
has O
to O
be O
-- O
applied O
but O
until O
now O
-- O
she O
did O
n't O
put O
any O
pressure O
, O
eh O
, O
toward O
( O
( O
this O
and O
) O
) O
and O
I O
believe O
this O
policy O
has O
been O
, O
uh O
, O
this O
kind O
of O
policy O
, O
eh O
, O
um O
, O
eh O
, O
became O
more O
and O
more O
during O
-- O
eh O
, O
during O
, O
uh O
, O
eh O
, O
Bush O
-- O
-- O
President O
Bush O
time O
. O

For O
example O
, O
before O
, O
eh O
, O
during O
Clinton O
, O
I O
believe O
at O
that O
time O
-- O
Clinton O
was O
trying O
hard O
-- O
to O
solve O
this O
problem O
and O
I O
believe O
at O
that O
time O
, O
if O
you O
remember O
, O
um O
, O
Yasser O
Arafat O
-- O
and O
, O
uh O
, O
the O
prime O
minister O
of O
Israel B-LOC
, O
his O
name O
was O
Barak O
, O
they O
met O
together O
in O
the O
White O
House O
-- O
and O
-- O
they O
almost O
came O
to O
an O
agreement O
-- O
to O
solve O
this O
problem O
-- O
and O
during O
Clinton O
, O
eh O
, O
period O
-- O
they O
had O
, O
uh O
, O
this O
( O
( O
Oslo B-LOC
) O
) O
a- O
eh O
, O
agreement O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
big O
problems O
between O
the O
two O
parties O
, O
they O
negotiated O
everything O
almost O
and O
there O
is O
-- O
there O
were O
, O
like O
, O
final O
steps O
that O
have O
to O
be O
solved O
. O

But O
, O
uh O
, O
I O
think O
if O
there O
was O
, O
like O
, O
the O
, O
um O
, O
the O
same O
policy O
has O
to O
be O
followed O
after O
Clinton O
. O

I O
think O
-- O
everything O
would- O
-- O
-finished O
then- O
-- O
the O
-- O
I O
think O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
-- O
went O
to O
another O
direction O
and O
, O
eh O
, O
they O
forgot O
about O
this O
problem O
right O
now O
. O

Mark O
Yeah O
, O
I O
g- O
eh O
, O
see O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
, O
Ali O
Mark O
um O
, O
when- O
when O
policy O
is O
set O
by O
one O
-- O
-- O
by O
one O
president O
-- O
towards- O
towards O
one O
thing O
, O
it O
's O
usually O
-- O
followed O
through O
, O
if O
there O
is O
something O
to O
follow O
through O
, O
by O
the O
-- O
next O
president O
in O
turn O
. O

He O
is O
more O
or O
less O
obligated O
-- O
to O
continue O
, O
uh O
, O
the O
process O
that O
was O
already O
started O
-- O
but O
-- O
I O
think O
-- O
Bush O
's O
-- O
agenda O
-- O
is O
not O
-- O
towards O
that O
right O
now O
. O

That O
is O
not O
his O
priority O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
. O

Ali O
Yeah O
, O
I O
think O
so O
, O
yes O
. O

Mark O
And O
, O
eh O
, O
uh O
, O
although O
, O
you O
know O
, O
it O
's O
been O
a O
long O
time O
-- O
that O
-- O
i- O
they O
have O
both O
-- O
b- O
both O
Israel B-LOC
and O
Palestine B-LOC
, O
they O
both O
need O
a O
-- O
they O
both O
need O
their O
own O
country O
-- O
and- O
Ali O
That O
's O
, O
uh O
, O
true O
because O
, O
uh O
, O
Mark O
an- O
-- O
eh O
, O
y- O
Ali O
in O
the O
United B-ORG
Nations I-ORG
they O
have O
established O
-- O
eh O
, O
they O
made O
this O
decision O
already O
. O

Mark O
R- O
right O
, O
right O
. O

Ali O
The O
-- O
uh O
, O
there O
, O
uh O
-- O
there O
has O
to O
be O
two O
countries O
, O
one O
of O
them O
for O
Palestine B-LOC
, O
Mark O
Right O
. O

Ali O
and O
another O
one O
for O
Israeli B-LOC
but O
, O
uh O
, O
Mark O
I- O
I- O
I O
agree O
a O
hundred O
percent O
, O
uh O
, O
Ali O
because O
, O
eh O
, O
i- O
Mark O
eh O
, O
but O
to O
get O
so O
involved O
in O
it O
. O

I O
think O
, O
the O
people O
, O
uh O
, O
the O
people O
that O
are O
in O
charge O
, O
the- O
eh O
, O
the O
people O
that O
run O
the O
governments O
there O
-- O
do O
need O
to O
sit O
down O
an- O
and- O
and O
be O
in O
touch O
with O
each O
other O
and O
if O
they O
need O
a O
mediator O
or O
something O
like O
that O
, O
that- O
Ali O
Which O
is O
played O
by O
U- O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
. O

This O
is O
the O
mediator O
which O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
is O
the O
one O
Mark O
R- O
Ali O
who O
has O
the O
power O
to O
convince O
both O
-- O
parties O
-- O
about- O
Mark O
Right O
. O

Right O
. O

Um O
, O
i- O
-- O
they O
-- O
in O

Ali O
Mark O
it O
's O
a O

-- O
eh O
, O
that O
i- O
-- O
that O
is O
what O
is O
need O
and O
un- O
Ali O
Mark O
unfortunately O
they O
've O
been O

they O
've O
been O
trying O
to O
get O
this O
settled O
and O
hashed O
out O
for O

twenty-five O

thirty O
years O

Ali O
Yeah O

Winnette O
Well O
um O
, O
I O
've O
been O
following O
it O
pretty O
closely O
. O

Um O
, O
I O
guess O
because O
of O
-- O
you O
know O
it O
being O
a O
mother O
and O
-- O
being O
pregnant O
for O
a O
baby O
. O

Irvin O

Winnette O
Um O
, O
kind O
of O
hit O
more O
to O
-- O
I O
you O
know O
to O
home O
. O

Um O
, O
So O
you O
-- O
how O
much O
of O
it O
have O
you O
followed O
? O

Did O
, O
did O
you O
-- O
follow O
any O
of O
it O
at O
all O
when O
it O
was O
on O
in O
the O
news O
or O
in O
the O
papers O
or O
anything O
? O

Irvin O
Hardly O
any O
of O
it O
at O
all O
, O
because O
-- O
um O
-- O
for O
one O
thing O
-- O
I O
do O
not O
have O
a O
~TV O
or O
a O
radio O
and O
I O
do O
n't O
get O
a O
daily O
newspaper O
. O

We O
get O
Winnette O
Oh O
wow O
. O

Irvin O
we O
get O
a O
weekly O
newspaper O
. O

Winnette O
Okay O
. O

Um O
, O
well O
I O
'll O
I O
do O
n't O
get O
any O
newspapers O
at O
the O
house O
, O
but O
-- O
I O
listen O
to O
the O
radio O
every O
morning O
on O
my O
way O
to O
work O
and O
Irvin O
Oh O
yeah O
? O

Winnette O
and O
uh O
-- O
when O
it O
first O
happened O
it O
was O
-- O
pretty O
publicized O
on O
every O
radio O
station O
um O
-- O
it O
come O
across O
-- O
on O
the O
news O
and O
we O
keep O
our O
~TV O
on O
at O
my O
work O
, O
because O
we O
have O
a O
customer O
waiting O
area O
, O
so O
Irvin O
Oh O
, O
uh-huh O
. O

Winnette O
um O
actually O
one O
of O
our O
employees O
had O
wa- O
watched O
( O
( O
happening O
) O
) O
-- O
so O
from O
that O
point O
on O
we O
kind O
of O
-- O
talked O
a O
lot O
about O
it O
at O
work O
and O
Irvin O
How O
long O
ago O
was O
it O
? O

Winnette O
different O
things O
. O

Um O
, O
it O
was O
a O
year O
-- O
almost O
a O
year O
ago O
. O

Over O
a O
year O
ago O
? O

Because O
it O
was O
just O
before O
Christmas O
-- O
that O
it O
happened O
. O

Irvin O
Over O
a O
year O
ago O
. O

Winnette O
Yeah O
. O

Um O
, O
I O
'm O
thinking O
-- O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
November O
, O
December O
, O
I O
'm O
not O
sure O
exactly O
. O

But O
I O
know O
it O
was O
just O
before O
Christmas O
-- O
when O
they O
had O
uh O
-- O
it O
had O
happened O
, O
because O
she O
was O
missing O
during O
Christmas O
and O
then O
they O
had O
found O
her O
body O
. O

And O
they O
-- O
they O
found O
the O
baby O
as O
well O
. O

Irvin O
Terrible O
. O

Winnette O
Um O
, O
so O
when O
they O
found O
the O
baby O
, O
the O
baby O
of O
course O
had O
been O
-- O
they O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
the O
baby O
was O
born O
, O
through O
delivery O
, O
or O
-- O
if O
maybe O
from O
um O
-- O
the O
corpse O
I O
guess O
Irvin O
So O
the O
baby O
was O
separate O
. O

Winnette O
maybe O
extracted O
it O
. O

Um O
, O
actually O
she O
was O
pregnant O
for O
the O
baby O
. O

Irvin O
But O
the O
baby O
was O
separate O
from O
the O
body O
when O
he O
found O
it O
? O

Winnette O
Yes O
. O

Yep O
. O

Um O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
ma- O
I O
you O
know O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
the O
whole O
story O
for O
sure O
, O
but O
-- O
um O
-- O
he O
had O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
obviously O
-- O
denied O
that O
he O
was O
involved O
anything O
to O
do O
with O
it O
. O

Then O
they O
found O
out O
that O
he O
was O
having O
an O
affair O
on O
her O
. O

And O
-- O
then O
of O
course O
when O
they O
were O
investigating O
him O
-- O
he O
tried O
running O
. O

Dyed O
his O
hair O
and O
-- O
grew O
out O
a O
mustache O
and O
-- O
they O
caught O
him O
trying O
to O
run O
with O
-- O
quite O
a O
bit O
of O
cash O
. O

Irvin O
Wow O
. O

Winnette O
So O
I O
mean O
, O
Irvin O
( O
( O
) O
) O
Winnette O
he O
's O
-- O
in O
all O
honesty O
been O
guilty O
all O
along O
the O
way O
but O
Irvin O
Uh-huh O
. O

Winnette O
of O
course O
you O
know O
they O
've O
got O
to O
give O
him O
that O
reasonable O
doubt O
. O

Irvin O
Uh-huh O
. O

So O
is O
he O
is O
he O
still O
um O
-- O
in O
prison O
now O
? O

Winnette O
Yeah O
. O

And O
they O
're O
making O
the O
determination O
if O
-- O
in O
fact O
he O
will O
get O
the O
death O
penalty O
, O
or O
life O
in O
prison O
. O

So O
that O
's O
what O
's O
is O
up O
in O
the O
air O
right O
now O
. O

Irvin O
What O
state O
is O
this O
in O
? O

Winnette O
California B-LOC
. O

Irvin O
It O
's O
in O
California B-LOC
. O

Winnette O
And O
-- O
um O
-- O
I O
know O
I O
had O
, O
it O
was O
supposed O
to O
have O
be O
deliberated O
on O
-- O
the O
twenty-second O
of O
November O
, O
but O
they O
had O
an O
issue O
happen O
with O
-- O
one O
of O
the O
jurors O
-- O
so O
it O
's O
postponed O
everything O
. O

But O
, O
actually O
they O
were O
trying O
to O
pass O
a O
law O
, O
and O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
it O
ever O
did O
take O
into O
effect O
, O
that O
if O
in O
fact O
a O
mother O
was O
killed O
, O
and O
pregnant O
, O
um O
-- O
for O
there O
to O
be O
a O
double O
murder O
charge O
. O

Irvin O
Oh O
, O
uh-huh O
. O

Winnette O
And O
-- O
they O
were O
in O
fact O
trying O
to O
enforce O
the O
death O
penalty O
on O
that O
charge O
if O
they O
were O
-- O
found O
guilty O
on O
both O
charges O
. O

Irvin O
Uh-huh O
. O

Winnette O
And O
-- O
so O
it O
's O
kind O
of O
up O
in O
the O
air O
now O
-- O
because O
he O
-- O
I O
believe O
he O
got O
first O
degree O
murder O
and O
-- O
um O
and O
then O
got O
manslaughter O
on O
the O
baby O
. O

So O
he O
did O
n't O
get O
both O
first O
degree O
murders O
. O

Irvin O
What O
's O
the O
difference O
? O

Winnette O
Where O
-- O
Um O
, O
I O
guess O
because O
he O
did O
n't O
murder O
the O
baby O
directly O
. O

Irvin O
Oh O
. O

Winnette O
I O
'm O
thinking O
maybe O
was O
the O
difference O
. O

And O
because O
of O
the O
the O
charge O
on O
the O
baby O
, O
they O
could O
n't O
automatically O
give O
him O
the O
death O
penalty O
, O
but O
-- O
obviously O
there O
's O
enough O
-- O
um O
, O
complaints O
or O
whatever O
Irvin O
What O
was O
his O
excuse O
for O
doing O
something O
horrible O
like O
that O
? O

Winnette O
and O
-- O
well O
he O
still O
denies O
everything O
. O

He O
has O
never O
admitted O
Irvin O
( O
( O
Still O
does O
) O
) O
Winnette O
to O
do O
it O
. O

um O
-- O
But O
the O
only O
thing O
they O
can O
figure O
is O
that O
maybe O
-- O
he O
wanted O
back O
into O
the O
bachelor O
life O
, O
and O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
be O
a O
father O
, O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
be O
tied O
down O
with O
a O
wife O
and O
child O
Irvin O
So O
he O
did O
n't O
have O
any O
other O
children O
? O

Winnette O
that O
was O
-- O
No O
, O
that O
was O
going O
to O
be O
their O
first O
. O

And O
actually O
I O
don't O
even O
think O
they O
were O
married O
that O
long O
, O
maybe O
a O
year O
or O
two O

Ted O

Obo O
ever O
, O
I O
usually O
try O
to O
stay O
out O
of O
the O
main O
party O
, O
because O
I O
think O
, O
and O
this O
last O
election O
showed O
that O
both O
are O
very O
brutal O
. O

Ted O
It O
was O
Obo O
Um O
, O
yeah O
I O
think O
that O
the O
, O
uh O
Ted O
election O
. O

Obo O
Oh O
, O
I O
'm O
sorry O

Ted O
It O
was O
a O

Obo O
Yeah O
, O
yeah O
, O
it O

, O
yeah O
, O
you O
're O
absolutely O
, O

, O
and O
I O
'm O

I O

, O
if O
you O
want O

I O
'm O

Ted O
No O
no O
, O

go O
ahead O

Obo O
And O
, O
ah O
-- O
It O
's O
, O
it O
's O
just O
that O
-- O
Like O
, O
I O
I O
just O
, O
I O
think O
that O
the O
last O
fifty O
years O
, O
the O
government O
has O
been O
mes- O
messed O
up O
by O
both O
these O
parties O
, O
honestly O
. O

Even O
maybe O
before O
that O
. O

So O
, O
I O
, O
I O
usually O
do O
third O
party O
-- O
um O
, O
and O
the O
way O
it O
was O
working O
this O
year O
was O
that O
the O
Democrats O
really O
pushed O
to O
get O
Ralph O
Nader O
off O
the O
ballot O
Ted O
Yeah O
. O

Yeah O
they O
did O
. O

Obo O
in O
every O
state O
, O
and O
um O
-- O
I O
mean O
, O
the O
Republicans O
sort O
of O
tried O
to O
play O
like O
they O
were O
helping O
him O
out O
, O
but O
they O
knew O
they O
they O
did O
n't O
really O
have O
to O
because O
they O
knew O
the O
Democrats O
were O
already O
doing O
more O
damage O
to O
keep O
him O
off O
the O
ballot O
and O
they O
were O
successful O
, O
and O
for O
a O
progressive O
party O
that O
was O
very O
brutal O
. O

Ted O
Mhm O
, O
it O
was O
. O

Obo O
And O
I O
was O
n't O
really O
impressed O
by O
either O
of O
the O
two O
vice O
presidential O
candidates O
, O
I O
know O
Dick O
Cheney O
seems O
to O
be O
running O
the O
show O
Ted O
You O

Obo O
and O
, O
ah O
-- O
I O
mean O
, O
and O
, O
and O
a O
lot O
of O
it O
has O
to O
do O
-- O
and O
then O
, O
I O
just O
did O
n't O
know O
much O
, O
John O
Edwards O
seemed O
nice O
, O
but O
he O
just O
, O
you O
know O
, O
he O
was O
just O
, O
he O
just O
got O
elected O
to O
the O
Senate B-ORG
, O
and O
, O
I O
was O
n't O
really O
familiar O
too O
much O
with O
hi- O
I O

, O
I O
think O
it O
's O
great O
that O
he O
got O
into O
the O
vice O
presidential O
role O
, O
but O
-- O
again O
, O
it O
's O
the O
whole O
parties O
that O
I O
'm O
really O
not O
really O
I O
do O
n't O
like O
their O
policies O
. O

Ted O
Well O
, O
you O
kind O
of O
hit O
on O
some O
of O
my O
sentiments O
, O
um O
, O
I O
'm O
a O
fifty-year- O
old O
black O
male O
, O
and O
this O
was O
my O
first O
election O
that O
I O
participated O
in O
. O

And O
the O
reason O
was O
was O
that O
, O
ah O
, O
I O
'm O
retired O
Air B-ORG
Force I-ORG
-- O
and O
before O
, O
ah O
, O
because O
I O
was O
in O
the O
military O
-- O
ah O
, O
did O
n't O
did O
n't O
really O
think O
that O
my O
vote O
, O
um O
, O
counted O
one O
way O
or O
the O
other O
, O
that O
's O
that O
was O
my O
thinking O
. O

You O
know O
, O
I O
had O
a O
role O
to O
fulfill O
and O
regardless O
of O
how O
I O
voted O
, O
uh O
, O
I O
was O
going O
to O
have O
to O
fulfill O
that O
role O
. O

Um O
, O
Obo O
Yeah O
. O

Ted O
the O
, O
the O
situation O
, O
though O
, O
now O
that O
I O
'm O
out O
and O
, O
in O
the O
civilian O
sector O
, O
um O
, O
I O
find O
that O
the O
economics O
as O
far O
as O
home O
-- O
is O
what O
I'm O
most O
concerned O
with O
. O

And O
because O
of O
the O
economic O
situation O
, O
I O
don't O
think O
that O
's O
being O
addressed O
. O

Yes O
, O
I O
feel O
very O
, O
very O
bad O
in O
regards O
to O
the O
, O
ah O
, O
nine-eleven O
tragedy O
and O
terrorism O
and O
this O
kind O
of O
stuff O
Obo O
Mhm O
. O

Ted O
um O
, O
but O
I O
think O
so O
much O
attention O
is O
being O
paid O
to O
that O
-- O
that O
-- O
as O
you O
mentioned O
, O
over O
the O
past O
fifty O
years O
, O
the O
two O
parties O
that O
run O
the O
country O
-- O
um O
, O
have O
definitely O
taken O
a O
, O
um O
-- O
streamlined O
approach O
to O
whatever O
their O
agenda O
may O
be O
and O
not O
the O
will O
of O
the O
people O
. O

Obo O
You O
said O
it O
very O
well O
. O

I O
totally O
, O
you O
coul- O
I O
could O
n't O
have O
said O
it O
better O
. O

Ted O
Now O
it O
's O
uh O
-- O
and O
as O
time O
goes O
on O
, O
you O
know O
, O
like O
, O
ah O
, O
what O
are O
we O
, O
you O

what O
are O
we O

Obo O
I O
I O

n't O

now O
, O
yeah O

we O

I O
heard O
a O
commentary O
by O
Rush O
Limbaugh O
, O
ah O
, O
the O
other O
day O

and O
the O
comment O
was O

was O
that O

yeah O
. O

Ivan O
Yeah O
, O
I O
, O
uh O
, O
I O
voted O
. O

John O
Uh-huh O
. O

Ivan O
Um O
, O
uh O
, O
and O
, O
uh O
, O
yeah O
, O
I O
-- O
feel O
the O
same O
way O
. O

I O
get O
-- O
regardless O
of O
what O
year O
it O
is O
or O
who O
the O
candidates O
are O
I O
get O
tired O
of O
listening O
to O
it O
. O

It O
-- O
basically O
all O
of O
it O
's O
the O
same O
thing O
all O
the O
time O
and O
, O
uh O
, O
John O
Uh-huh O
. O

Ivan O
they O
, O
uh O
, O
tell O
you O
the O
same O
thing O
and O
then O
they O
turn O
around O
and O
-- O
do O
something O
different O
all O
the O
time O
anyway O
, O
so O
it O
's O
-- O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
it O
's O
, O
uh O
, O
I O
guess O
it O
's O
wor- O
-- O
worth O
voting O
, O
but O
-- O
sometimes O
I O
wonder O
. O

I O
've O

I O
guess O
we O
-- O
said O
what O

but O
, O
uh O
, O
Kerry O
, O
I O

, O
it O
's O
just O
that O
-- O
-coast O
, O
uh O
, O
kind O
of O
persona O
or O
image O
, O
-t O
, O
uh O
, O
I O
-- O
do O
n't O
care O
for O
, O
for O

kind O
of O
out O
your O
way O
, O
uh O
, O
Wyoming B-LOC
. O

John O
Uh-huh O
. O

Ivan O
Uh O
, O
uh O
, O
he O
's O
kind O
of O
a O
non-descript O
person O
, O
as O
far O
as O
, O
like O
I O
I'm O
sure O
he O
's O
he O
's O
probably O
a O
nice O
guy O
, O
and O
-- O
a O
lot O
of O
fun O
at O
a O
party O
probably O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
but O
, O
you O
know O
, O
just O
from O
-- O
what O
you O
see O
of O
him O
, O
he O
's O
just O
kind O
of O
-- O
kind O
of O
like O
an O
old O
grandpa O
, O
you O
know O
. O

John O
Yeah O
, O
he O
's O
real O
grouchy O
. O

Ivan O
Yeah O
, O
he O
just O
John O
In O
those O
debates O
he O
was O
like O
a O
pitbull O
. O

Ivan O
Yeah O
, O
yeah O
. O

John O
You O

, O
he O
would O
c- O

he O
kind O
of O
picked O
apart O
Edwards O
Ivan O
Mhm O

um O
, O
but O
then O
-- O
Edwards O
fought O
back O
kind O
of O
-- O
you O

then O
all O

suing O
insurance O
companies O
and O
, O
um O
, O
you O
know O

there- O
there O
's O
-- O
bad O
stuff O
you O
hear O
about O
both O
of O
them O
that O
, O
you O
know O

obviously O
they O
want O
to O
tell O
you O
Ivan O
Yeah O
. O

Yeah O
. O

John O
that O
I O
did O
n't O
like O

, O
I O
guess O
I O
did O
n't O
really O
like O
that O
, O
uh O
, O
uh O
, O
Kerry O
was O
, O
like O
, O
changing O
his O
story O
all O
the O
time O
, O
like O
, O
oh O
, O
I- O
-- O
I O
believe O

Ivan O

of O
a O

Ivan O

Ivan O
Yeah O
. O

John O
try O
to O
beat O
around O

something O
like O

Ivan O

certain O
degree O

Marco O
Oh O

Derek O
Derek O

Marco O
Derek O

Derek O

, O
nice O
to O
meet O
you O
. O

Derek O

, O
you O
too O
. O

Marco O
Um O
Derek O
How O
's O
it O
going O
? O

Marco O
Good O
, O
good O
. O

So O
, O
uh O
the O
election O
, O
um O
-- O
the O
, O
um O
-- O
let O
's O
see O
, O
overall O
I O
felt O
-- O
ju- O
just O
give O
you O
a O
brief O
-- O
summary O
, O
I O
felt O
-- O
that O
-- O
John O
Kerry O
and O
Edwards O
were O
were O
pretty O
strong O
candidates O
and O
-- O
uh O
-- O
mm O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
I O
guess O
just O
in O
terms O
of O
policy O
I O
did O
n't O
-- O
I O
did O
n't O
, O
uh O
, O
find O
-- O
that O
as O
compelling O
as O
just O
-- O
the O
personality O
of O
-- O
the O
different O
candidates O
. O

Derek O
Yeah O
. O

Marco O
felt O
like O
I O
could O
trust O
Kerry O
-- O
uh O
, O
little O
bit O
more O
even O
though O
he O
was O
much O
more O
of O
a O
politician O
than O
Bush O
. O

Derek O
Mhm O
. O

Mhm O
. O

Marco O
Uh O
, O
he O
was O
-- O
kind O
of O
a O
smooth O
talker O
and O
Derek O
Mhm O
. O

Marco O
Um O
-- O
uh O
-- O
seems O
like O
a O
politician O
, O
they O
way O
he O
presented O
Derek O
Mhm O
. O

Marco O
his O
you O
know O
his O
his O
um O
argument O
. O

But O
-- O
uh O
-- O
strangely O
I O
felt O
like O
that O
what O
, O
that O
was O
-- O
one O
of O
-- O
one O
of O
his O
good O
qualities O
because O
I O
didn't O
feel O
Bush O
was O
politician O
enough O
. O

That O
um O
-- O
one O
of O
the O
-- O
issues O
that O
I O
was O
concerned O
about O
was O
just O
-- O
the O
representation O
of O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
and O
-- O
on O
the O
international O
stage O
Derek O
Sure O
. O

Marco O
and O
I O
just O
-- O
uh O
-- O
I O
uh O
-- O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
uh O
, O
Bush O
is O
-- O
the O
way O
he O
presents O
um O
-- O
the O
~US B-LOC
position O
-- O
uh O
-- O
seemed O
a O
little O
-- O
abrasive O
to O
me O
. O

Derek O
Mhm O
. O

Marco O
And O
I O
-- O
felt O
like O
, O
hm O
-- O
if O
we O
're O
trying O
to O
, O
um O
-- O
make O
-- O
um O
-- O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
safer O
and O
more O
stable O
-- O
conflict O
in O
the O
world O
more O
stable O
then O
we O
probably O
need O
somebody O
-- O
who O
is O
a O
little O
bit O
more O
-- O
of O
a O
politician O
in O
the O
sense O
that O
-- O
the O
, O
they O
care O
about O
diplomacy O
and O
-- O
uh O
, O
even O
though O
we O
may O
not O
-- O
give O
in O
to O
-- O
the O
will O
of O
the O
other O
nations O
present O
it O
in O
a O
nicer O
way O
. O

Derek O
Mhm O
. O

Marco O
Yeah O
, O
it O
seems O
( O
( O
I O
make O
) O
) O
kind O
of O
simplistic O
, O
but O
-- O
that O
was O
-- O
an O
important O
thing O
for O
me O
. O

Uh O
Derek O
Yeah O
. O

Marco O
Yeah O
. O

Derek O
Um O
-- O
I O
was O
a O
little O
different O
. O

I O
I O
I O
agree O
with O
everything O
you O
said O
. O

I O
just O
, O
um O
-- O
I O
come O
from O
a O
little O
different O
background O
as O
far O
as O
being O
-- O
I O
was O
never O
into O
politics O
and O
now O
I O
I O
actually O
have O
gotten O
into O
God O
much O
more O
and O
and O
, O
you O
know O
, O
searching O
spirituality O
out O
. O

Marco O
Uh O
huh O
. O

Derek O
Generally O
people O
like O
that O
are O
conservative O
, O
you O
know O
, O
Marco O
Yeah O
. O

Derek O
uh O
, O
with O
their O
views O
because O
of O
different O
things O
like O
abortion O
and O
, O
and O
, O
uh O
, O
pro-life O
and O
-- O
all O
that O
kind O
of O
thing O
so O
I O
came O
form O
that O
background O
Marco O
Uh O
huh O
. O

Derek O
eh O
, O
but O
that O
was O
just O
an O
added O
bonus O
for O
me O
in O
the O
fact O
that O
-- O
I O
too O
was O
obviously O
at O
this O
point O
in O
time O
concerned O
about O
the O
welfare O
of O
our O
security O
-- O
and O
I O
felt O
personally O
that O
if O
-- O
Kerry O
was O
in O
office O
we O
'd O
kind O
of O
be O
, O
uh O
-- O
up O
a O
creek O
without O
a O
paddle O
because O
I O
think O
-- O
he O
is O
so O
laid O
back O
-- O
um O
, O
and O
not O
as O
aggressive O
as O
Bush O
that O
at O
this O
point O
in O
the O
game O
, O
where O
we O
're O
at O
-- O
we O
're O
in O
this O
thing O
full O
full O
-- O
steam O
ahead O
Marco O
Uh O
huh O
. O

Derek O
and O
for O
a O
transition O
to O
occur O
at O
this O
point O
-- O
to O
someone O
who O
is O
laid O
back O
-- O
and O
not O
as O
aggressive O
as O
him O
I O
think O
would O
actually O
endanger O
the O
~US B-LOC
even O
more O
. O

Marco O
Yeah O
. O

Derek O
I O
think O
that O
the O
international O
, O
uh O
uh O
, O
leaders O
would O
look O
at O
Kerry O
and O
know O
, O
they O
're O
very O
smart O
, O
I O
mean O
they O
're O
-- O
they O
're O
on O
top O
of O
these O
things O
, O
they O
know O
, O
you O
know O
, O
it O
would O
, O
it O
just O
would O
have O
opened O
a O
gateway O
. O

Marco O
Uh O
huh O
. O

Derek O
I O
feel O
Marco O
Yeah O
. O

Derek O
that O
, O
uh O
, O
it O
may O
have O
actually O
put O
us O
in O
more O
danger O
. O

At O
least O
Bush O
has O
-- O
pulled O
out O
the O
gun O
, O
you O
know O
, O
stick O
to O
them O
, O
and O
um O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
that O
's O
where O
I O
was O
coming O
from O
on O
that O
. O

Marco O
Yeah O
. O

Derek O
And O
then O
when O
I O
Marco O
( O
( O
Do O
you O
think O
) O
) O
Derek O
I O
listen O
to O
a O
lot O
of O
talk O
radio O
and O
when O
I O
heard O
the O
stuff O
about O
Kerry O
back O
in O
the O
-- O
the O
the O
, O
apparently O
the O
scandals O
he O
's O
pulled O
as O
far O
as O
the O
uh O
, O
medals O
when O
he O
served O
time O
. O

Marco O
Uh O
huh O
. O

Derek O
You O
know O
, O
uh O
-- O
I O
listen O
to O
a O
lot O
of O
talk O
radio O
and O
spoke O
with O
, O
you O
know O
, O
heard O
from O
a O
lot O
of O
, O
uh O
-- O
veterans O
-- O
and O
they O
said O
it O
was O
physically O
, O
uh O
, O
impossible O
for O
him O
to O
achieve O
what O
he O
said O
he O
did O
. O

Marco O
Uh O
huh O
. O

Uh O
huh O
. O

Derek O
And O
all O
the O
meetings O
he O
's O
missing O
, O
and O
just O
, O
you O
know O
, O
I O
think O
it's O
more O
of O
a O
status O
quo O
for O
him O
. O

Marco O
Yeah O
. O

Derek O
I O
think O
he O
's O
more O
, O
he O
got O
so O
much O
money O
that O
I O
think O
he O
was O
just O
concerned O
with O
attaining O
this O
position O
and O
a O
title O
. O

Marco O
Yeah O
. O

Derek O
you O
know O
( O
( O
flag O
) O
) O
for O
him O
, O
so O
Marco O
Do O
you O
think O
, O
um O
-- O
the O
-- O
when O
the O
Republicans O
are O
campaigning O
-- O
they O
were O
saying O
that O
well O
, O
another O
attack O
on O
the O
U.S B-LOC
. O

is O
-- O
imminent O
, O
that O
it O
probably O
-- O
probably O
going O
to O
happen O
-- O
and O
-- O
um O
-- O
and O
-- O
they O
even O
went O
so O
far O
to O
say O
that O
if O
-- O
it O
's O
really O
difficult O
to O
prevent O
something O
like O
this O
and O
of O
course O
they O
're O
doing O
the O
best O
they O
can O
and O
-- O
I O
think O
Kerry O
would O
do O
the O
best O
he O
could O
. O

But O
do O
you O
think O
, O
um O
-- O
that O
-- O
and O
this O
is O
n't O
quite O
a O
political O
issue O
, O
but O
do O
you O
think O
that O
-- O
there O
's O
going O
to O
be O
another O
attack O
on O
the O
~US B-LOC
? O

Uh O
like O
in O
the O
next O
five O
years O
? O

Something O
big O
like O
-- O
the O
world O
( O
( O
) O
) O
Derek O
I O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
your O
beliefs O
are O
, O
as O
far O
as O
, O
uh O
-- O
biblically O
or O
spiritually O
or O
whatever O
, O
but O
-- O
I O
believe O
it O
's O
inevitable O
. O

I O
mean O
, O
we're O
going O
down O
, O
you O
know O
? O

And O
, O
yeah O
, O
and O
this O
is O
, O
all O
these O

Ed O
Good O
. O

James O
Well O
, O
what O
do O
you O

Ed O
I O
think O
I O
was O
on O
this O
one O
yesterday O
, O
same O
subject O
. O

James O
I O
, O
I O
believe O
I O

Ed O
Uh O
, O
Well O
, O
let O
's O
see O
, O
my O
past O
views O
were O
, O
uh O
-- O
illness-wise O
, O
ah O
-- O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
-- O
it O
helped O
him O
, O
being O
in O
the O
compound O
. O

James O
Right O
. O

Right O
. O

Ed O
But O
, O
You O

, O
you O

, O
you O
're O
never O
going O

if O
there O
was O
any O

ah O

ah O
, O
illness O
. O

James O
Mhm O

Ed O
I O

they O
, O
ah O
, O
( O
( O

) O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
you O

ever O
going O

out O
if O
there O
was O
any O
direct O
James O
Right O

Ed O
tampering O
James O
Right O
. O

Ed O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
, O
you O
know O
, O
from O
just O
the O
generic O
point O
, O
or O
general O
point O
of O
view O
, O
it O
did O
n't O
help O
his O
illness O
once O
he O
got O
-- O
sick O
-- O
being O
in O
the O
compound O
, O
closed O
in O
like O
that O
with O
the O
Arabs O
. O

James O
Right O
. O

Right O
. O

Ed O
And O
that O
James O
I O
do O
n't O
-- O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
I O
think O
there O
was O
something O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
malicious O
done O
, O
because O
, O
you O
know O
, O
looking O
back O
-- O
he O
's O
been O
had O
this O
shaking O
thing O
going O
on O
Ed O
Yeah O
. O

James O
for O
quite O
some O
time O
. O

And O
I O
agree O
that O
the O
surroundings O
could O
n't O
have O
helped O
. O

Ed O
Right O
. O

James O
Yeah O
, O
it O
, O
it O
could O
've O
only O
exacerbated O
, O
uh O
, O
his O
situation O
. O

Because O
for O
-- O
for O
a O
good O
little O
while O
now O
I O
've O
noticed O
, O
you O
know O
, O
that O
his O
lips O
would O
tremble O
, O
and O
Ed O
Yeah O
. O

James O
and O
, O
you O
know O
, O
it O
's O
like O
, O
um O
, O
uh O
, O
almost O
like O
he O
had O
, O
uh O
, O
what O
is O
that O
, O
Parkinson O
's O
? O

Ed O
Yeah O
. O

James O
Uh O
, O
something O
like O
that O
, O
but O
, O
uh O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
the O
exact O
conditions O
were O
-- O
in O
that O
compound O
, O
but O
they O
could O
n't O
have O
been O
could O
n't O
have O
been O
, O
ah O
, O
conducive O
to O
someone O
of O
his O
age O
-- O
and O
of O
his O
health O
-- O
and O
as O
far O
as O
, O
as O
, O
ah O
, O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
sending O
a O
senior O
~US B-LOC
official O
, O
I O
think O
they O
should O
've O
sent O
someone O
-- O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
senior O
that O
person O
had O
to O
be O
. O

But O
, O
uh O
, O
it O
could O
've O
been O
a O
gesture O
Ed O
Well O
they O
did O
-- O
they O
did O
send O
somebody O
, O
I O
thought O
. O

Did O
n't O
they O
go O
with O
a O
senior O
official O
, O
I O
had O
James O
to O
Ed O
did O
n't O
think O
they O
were O
going O
to O
ask O
this O
question O
, O
but O
I O
James O
Oh O
y- O
yeah O
, O
you O
're O
right O
, O
they O
did O
send O
someone O
. O

Ed O
but O
it O
was O
n't O
-- O
like O
, O
ah O
, O
was O
n't O
Bush O
, O
I O
definitely O
would O
n't O
send O
him O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
you O
want O
to O
have O
him O
in O
that O
part O
of O
the O
world O
right O
now O
. O

James O
Right O
. O

No O
. O

No O
. O

No O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
Ed O
Regardless O
of O
what O
you O
think O
about O
him O
, O
he O
's O
, O
ah O
James O
Yeah O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
he O
should O
have O
went O
-- O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
fact O
, O
I O
don't O
think O
any O
senior O
official O
should O
've O
went O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
-- O
Secretary O
of O
State O
Colin O
Powell O
should O
have O
went O
. O

Uh O
, O
whoever O
they O
sent O
was O
, O
was O
good O
enough O
. O

Ed O
Yeah O
. O

James O
Yeah O
, O
was O
good O
enough O
, O
just O
to O
show O
-- O
the O
Palestinian B-LOC
people O
-- O
that O
, O
uh O
you O
know O
, O
America B-LOC
does O
care O
somewhat O
-- O
that O
you O
've O
lost O
your O
leader O
. O

But O
, O
uh O
, O
no O
, O
it O
would O
've O
been O
-- O
it O
would O
've O
been O
a O
wro- O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
fact O
, O
I O
think O
sending O
Bush O
would O
have O
made O
it O
worse O
. O

You O
know O
. O

Uh O
, O
because O
he O
's O
not O
liked O
that O
much O
by O
the O
Palestinian B-LOC
people O
. O

So O
I O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
sending O
him O
would O
've O
been O
-- O
would O
've O
been O
the O
right O
thing O
to O
do O
. O

Ed O
No O
, O
I O
agree O
with O
that O
. O

James O
Yeah O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
would O
've O
added O
anything O
to O
-- O
to O
the O
situation O
. O

and O
possibly O
could O
've O
made O
it O
worse O
. O

Ed O
Yeah O
. O

James O
Yeah O
. O

Ed O
As O
to O
-- O
his O
burial O
James O
Mhm O
. O

Ed O
ah O
, O
Not O
anymore O
, O
these O
are O
all O
, O
uh O
like O
these O
are O
all O
political O
responses O
James O
Huh O
. O

Right O
. O

Ed O
you O
know O
, O
there O
is O
no O
right O
answer O
, O
considering O
that O
that O
is O
not O
James O
Mhm O
. O

Ed O
you O
know O
, O
they O
're O
still O
arguing O
over O
-- O
that O
land O
, O
and O
is O
it O
, O
ah O
James O
Yeah O
. O

Ed O
who O
owns O
it O
and O
respect O
, O
so O
I O
mean O
it's O
James O
Mhm O
. O

I O
'd O
say O
my O
overall O
opinion O
is O
that O
-- O
this O
conflict O
is O
way O
past O
that O
time O
. O

Ed O
Yeah O
, O
well O
, O
James O
You O
know O
, O
it O
's O
been O
going O

for O
all O
these O
many O
-- O
what O
, O
Ed O
Hundreds O
. O

James O
hundreds O
of O
years O
-- O
and O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
have O
lost O
their O
lives O
, O
and O
and O
a O
lot O
of O
kids O
have O
grown O
up O
and O
all O
they O
've O
ever O
known O
-- O
on O
both O
sides O
Israeli B-LOC
and O
Palestinian B-LOC
, O
all O
they O
've O
ever O
known O
is O
war O
. O

And O
it O
's O
just O
tiresome O
. O

I O
mean O
, O
that O
's O
, O
that O
's O
my O
, O
my O
view O
, O
this O
thing O
has O
gone O
so O
long O
-- O
like O
you O
said O
, O
about O
a O
piece O
of O
land O
. O

And O
it O
's O
just O
, O
you O
know O
, O
They O
, O
they O
, O
they O
got O
to O
learn O
at O
some O
point O
-- O
that O
they O
're O
going O
to O
have O
to O
be O
able O
to O
get O
along O

Or O
this O
is O
just O
going O

, O
you O

the O
the O

the O
Palestinians B-LOC
will O
, O
will O
, O
will O
-- O
will O
-- O
will O
do O
something O
, O
then O
Israel B-LOC
will O
respond O

and O
then O
back O

and O
it O
's O
just O
like O
a O
never O

I O

What O

You O

it O
was O

Paul O

-- O
( O

no O

I O
I O
heard O

just O
a O

-- O
I O
I O
kind O
of O
doubt O
it O
or O
at O

I O
hope O
not O

I O
guess O
that O
's O
what O
it O
is O
. O

Mike O
Yeah O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
he O
was O
poisoned O
. O

I O
think O
he O
was O
just O
fr- O
frail O
and O
I O
think O
he O
'd O
been O
uh O
, O
he O
'd O
been O
looking O
frail O
and O
he O
was O
shaky O
. O

Paul O

. O

Mike O
You O
know O
, O
he O
'd O
been O
looking O
h- O
like O
he O
was O
shaking O

, O
uh O
, O
seeming O
frail O

For O
some O
time O
when O
I O
'd O

him O

uh O
, O
Paul O

, O
that O

true O
. O

so O
forth O

Paul O
Right O
. O

Mike O
And O
I O
think O
it O
whatever O
it O
was O
, O
it O
got O
him O
, O
just O
caught O
up O
with O
him O
and O
and O
he O
reached O
the O
you O

the O

I O
I O
guess O
now O
that O
that O
he O
's O
he O
's O
died O
-- O
it O
'll O
be O
, O
uh O
, O
or O
it O
it O
should O
be O
a O
change O
for O
the O
~PLO B-ORG
Mike O
Well O
, O
yeah O
, O
it O
'll O
be O
change O
. O

I O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
it O
'll O
move O
forward O
any O
better O
-- O
but O
, O
uh O
, O
this O
, O
uh O
, O
I O
've O
heard O
our O
administration O
thinks O
it O
will O
. O

I O
think O
he O
was O
a O
block O
to O
the O
peace O
-- O
but O
I O
think O
it O
's O
not O
only O
his O
doing O
, O
it O
's O
also O
the O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
the O
, O
uh O
, O
more O
, O
uh O
, O
drastic O
elements O
of O
the O
~PLO B-ORG
that O
, O
uh O
, O
that O
, O
uh O
, O
would O
n't O
allow O
him O
to O
pursue O
peace O
Paul O
Right O
. O

Mike O
at O
any O
cost O
. O

Paul O
Well O
, O
I O
'm O
-- O
I O
'm O
-- O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
uh O
. O

He O
he O
seems O
like O
a O
guy O
who O
is O
much O
more O
comfortable O
-- O
being O
under O
siege O
than O
in O
negotiating O
peace O
settlements O
. O

Mike O
Uh-huh O
. O

Paul O
Um O
, O
I O
Mike O
Yeah O
. O

Paul O
maybe O
that O
Mike O
Well O
, O
you O
know O
, O
he O
was O
kind O
of O
damned O
if O
he O
did O
and O
damned O
if O
he O
did O
n't O
. O

Paul O
Yeah O
. O

Well O
Mike O
You O
know O
, O
if O
he O
if O
he O
made O
peace O
he O
had O
factions O
of O
his O
own O
people O
that O
would O
've O
killed O
him O
-- O
and O
if O
he O
did O
n't O
make O
peace O
, O
eh O
, O
then O
he's O
considered O
, O
you O
know O
, O
the O
the O
warmongering O
, O
uh O
, O
man O
who O
wo O
n't O
make O
peace O
, O
you O
know O
. O

So O
, O
he O
, O
uh O
, O
he O
could O
n't O
really O
win O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
he O
could O
make O
peace O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
anyone O
else O
can O
, O
either O
. O

Paul O
Yeah O
, O
I O
guess O
that O
's O
the O
big O
question O
, O
if O
someone O
moderate O
takes O
over O
and O
they O
reach O
a O
settlement O
, O
does O
that O
mean O
the O
~PLO B-ORG
will O
split O
? O

I O
mean O
that O
-- O
that O
could O
be O
just O
-- O
dangerous O
. O

Mike O
Yeah O
. O

Paul O
I O
guess O
, O
uh O
, O
making O
peace O
with O
half O
of O
the O
Palestinians O
is O
better O
than O
nothing O
. O

Mike O
One O
of O
the O
other O
questions O
it O
asked O
us O
was O
, O
did O
we O
think O
our O
president O
and O
our O
, O
uh O
, O
you O
know O
, O
officials O
should O
've O
attended O
his O
funeral O
. O

Paul O
( O
( O
Oh O
, O
I O
b- O
) O
) O
Mike O
What O
do O
you O
think O
about O
that O
? O

Paul O
Yeah O
. O

Well O
, O
I O
I O
do O
n't O
remember O
who O
they O
sent O
, O
but O
they O
did O
send O
over O
some O
very O
-- O
low O
level O
state B-ORG
department I-ORG
person O
Mike O
Oh O
, O
I O
see O
. O

Paul O
and O
, O
uh O
, O
Mike O
I O
did O
n't O
know O
that O
. O

Paul O
I O
I O
-- O
I O
was O
kind O
of O
embarrassed O
about O
that O
. O

Mike O
That O
we O
did O
or O
d- O
that O
we O
did O
not O
send O
our O
officials O
. O

Paul O
I O
mean O
-- O
We O
-- O
we O
did O
, O
but O
i- O
it O
was O
some O
-- O
it O
was O
a O
nobody O
, O
basically O
. O

Mike O
So O
you O
were O
embarrassed O
because O
you O
thought O
they O
should O
've O
sent O
someone O
higher O
up O
? O

Paul O
Yeah O
. O

Mike O
Oh O
, O
I O
see O
. O

Paul O
I O
I O
-- O
I O
mean O
, O
for O
for O
the O
funeral O
ceremony O
in O
, O
uh O
, O
Egypt B-LOC
. O

( O
( O
I O
mean O
) O
) O
Mike O
Yeah O
, O
I O
think O
so O
, O
too O
. O

I O
think O
they O
should O
've O
sent O
someone O
higher O
up O
. O

Paul O
And O
, O
uh O
, O
I O
I O
can O
understand O
that O
they O
would O
n't O
want O
to O
send O
anybody O
Mike O
( O
( O
that O
he O
) O
) O
-- O
Do O
n't O
forget O
this O
was O
the O
this O
was O
the O
representative O
of O
a O
whole O
people O
, O
you O
know O
what O
I O
mean O
? O

Paul O
Yeah O
. O

Mike O
The O
past O
he O
was O
their O
main O
representative O
and O
, O
uh O
, O
just O
out O
of O
respect O
for O
the O
people O
we O
should O
've O
sent O
someone O
I O
think O
. O

Paul O
Hm O
. O

Bad O
bad O
or O
good O
. O

Yeah O
, O
I O
think O
it O
would O
've O
been O
a O
much O
more O
positive O
message O
. O

Mike O
Yeah O
. O

Paul O
( O
( O
We O
realized O
that O
) O
) O
Mike O
I O
think O
it O
would O
've O
, O
uh O
, O
you O
know O
, O
been O
a O
-- O
a O
step O
toward O
, O
um O
, O
you O
know O
, O
gaining O
the O
, O
uh O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
the O
respect O
and O
and O
the O
, O
um O
, O
Paul O
Right O
. O

Yeah O
, O
I O
think O
that O
Mike O
uh O
, O
th- O
of O
the O
people O
that O
we O
're O
going O
to O
have O
to O
be O
working O
with O
to O
try O
to O
bring O
about O
a O
peace O
, O
you O
know O
. O

Paul O
that O
( O
( O
yeah O
, O
) O
) O
it O
-- O
Yeah O
. O

Mike O
And O
, O
uh O
, O
it O
would O
've O
-- O
gone O
an- O
a O
little O
farther O
to O
encourage O
them O
to O
, O
you O
know O
, O
be O
willing O
to O
sit O
down O
at O
the O
table O
with O
us O
, O
at O
least O
, O
you O
know O
. O

Paul O
That O
's O
true O
. O

Mike O
And O
, O
I O
mean O
not O
that O
it O
would O
've O
even O
been O
noticed O
-- O
in O
that O
regard O
had O
he O
-- O
had O
had O
our O
president O
or O
someone O
higher O
gone O
, O
but O
the O
fact O
that O
they O
did O
n't O
, O
that O
's O
what O
's O
really O
going O
to O
be O
noticed O
, O
you O
know O
what O
I O
mean O
? O

Paul O
Yeah O
. O

Well O
, O
uh O
, O
you O
know O
, O
Colin O
Powell O
is O
a O
-- O
pretty O
moderate O
guy O
and O
would O
've O
been O
nice O
to O
see O
him O
there O
or O
maybe O
-- O
the O
, O
uh O
, O
Deputy O
-- O
Secret O
of O
State O
. O

Mike O
Uh-huh O
. O

Paul O
I O
'm O
not O
even O
sure O
who O
that O
is O
. O

Eh O
, O
somebody O
will O
-- O
or O
higher O
up O
. O

Mike O
Yeah O
, O
someone O
m- O
a O
little O
more O
, O
uh O
Paul O
Some O
flunky O
bureaucrat O
. O

Mike O
yeah O
. O

Yeah O
, O
it O
did O
n't O
seem O
quite O
appropriate O
. O

Paul O
But O
, O
uh O
, O
at O
at O
least O
for O
the O
ceremony O
in O
Egypt B-LOC
I O
think O
, O
uh O
, O
I O
can O
understand O
that O
no O
one O
would O
want O
to O
go O
into O
-- O
Palestinian B-LOC
territory O
. O

I O
mean O
, O
they O
it O
was O
total O
chaos O
there O
. O

Mike O
Uh-huh O

Sure O

Death O
of O
Arafat O
( O
2 O
) O
PLO B-ORG
leader O
PLO B-ORG
leader O
Yasser O
Arafat O
died O
in O
a O
Paris B-LOC
hospital O
last O
week O
, O
after O
a O
lot O
of O
controversy O
surrounding O
his O
illness O
and O
death O
. O

What O
do O
you O
think O
caused O
his O
illness O
, O
and O
could O
it O
have O
been O
something O
malicious O
( O
like O
poisoning O
) O
? O

What O
do O
you O
think O
of O
Israel B-LOC
's O
policies O
surrounding O
Arafat O
's O
illness O
and O
death O
? O

Should O
President O
Bush O
or O
a O
senior O
US B-LOC
official O
have O
attended O
Arafat O
's O
funeral O
? O

Should O
Israel B-LOC
have O
let O
Arafat O
be O
buried O
in O
Jerusalem B-LOC

Mike O
So- O
so O
what O
do O
you O
think O
? O

Marco O
Well O

I O
'm O
think- O
Mike O
How O
about O
you O
start O
. O

Marco O
Yeah O
, O
okay O
, O
um O
, O
( O
( O
lot O
of O
question O
) O
) O
-- O
and O
, O
um O
, O
I- O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
was O
poisoning O
, O
even O
though O
I O
have O
n't O
read O
-- O
a O
lot O
of O
articles O
about O
it O
. O

I O
think- O
Mike O
He- O
he O
was O
old O
. O

I O
mean- O
Marco O
Y- O
he O
was O
old O
, O
yeah O
. O

And- O
-- O
and O
that- O
I- O
I O
did O
n't O
realize O
he O
wasn't O
allowed O
to O
be O
buried O
in O
Jerusalem B-LOC
, O
which- O
Mike O
Yeah O
, O
but O
a O
lot O
of O
that O
has O
to O
do O
with O
things O
that O
he O
's O
done O
. O

Marco O
Yeah O
. O

Mike O
He's- O
I O
mean O
, O
like O
, O
you O
know O
, O
let's- O
i- O
-- O
for- O
for O
all O
he O
did O
in O
his O
later O
years O
, O
eh O
, O
Yasser O
Arafat O
was O
responsible O
for O
-- O
a O
good O
chunk O
of O
al- O
you O
know O
, O
a O
lot O
of O
-- O
Israeli O
dying O
-- O
i- O
you O
know O
. O

He O
basically O
, O
eh O
, O
i- O
I O
'm O
completely O
torn O
on O
the O
whole O
thing O
. O

I O
mean O
, O
on O
one O
hand O
-- O
I O
think O
it O
was O
kind O
of O
wrong O
that O
-- O
that O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
the O
~UN B-ORG
just O
kind O
of O
went O
in O
and O
said O
, O
hey O
, O
you O
know O
, O
guess O
what O
? O

You O
know O
, O
we're- O
we're O
you O
know O
, O
this O
is O
Israel B-LOC
now O
, O
state O
of O
Israel B-LOC
. O

And O
basically O
what O
they O
did O
was O
they O
carved O
up O
the O
region O
and- O
-- O
without O
any O
regard O
to O
, O
you O
know O
, O
tribal O
-- O
animosity O
really O
, O
is O
really O
what O
it O
boils O
down O
to O
, O
Marco O
Uh-huh O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Mike O
um O
. O

You O
know O
, O
then O
it O
th- O
it O
was O
there O
, O
he O
had O
to O
try O
to O
maintain O
the O
status O
quo O
-- O
but O
they O
bred O
-- O
people O
like O
Yasser O
Arafat O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
if O
it O
-- O
if O
it O
was O
n't O
for O
the O
stupidity O
of O
the O
United B-ORG
Nations I-ORG
, O
people O
like O
Yasser O
Yara- O
Arafat O
w- O
probably O
would O
've O
never O
even O
gotten O
off O
the O
ground O
, O
you O
know O
. O

Marco O
How O
how O
did O
the O
United B-ORG
Nations I-ORG
, O
uh O
, O
Arafat O
in O
power O
, O
or O
help O
? O

Mike O
Well O
, O
in O
other O
words O
eh O
, O
in O
other O
-- O
when O
-- O
after O
World O
War O
Two O
when O
they O
when O
-- O
basically O
the O
state O
of O
Israel B-LOC
was O
formed O
Marco O
Mhm O
. O

Mike O
in O
f- O
uh O
, O
nineteen O
forty O
eight O
, O
I O
think O
it O
was O
. O

Marco O
Yeah O
. O

Mike O
Um O
, O
you O
know O
, O
you- O
e- O
-- O
granted O
, O
you O
know O
, O
there O
were O
there O
were O
Jewish O
people O
already O
living O
there O
, O
but O
-- O
all O
the O
Jewish O
people O
started O
going O
there O
and O
they O
j- O
basically O
just- O
you O
know O
, O
they O
just O
took O
over O
. O

And- O
and O
Marco O
Yeah O
. O

Mike O
in O
in O
a O
region O
where O
, O
uh O
, O
you O
know O
, O
y- O
you O
know O
, O
we O
live O
in O
America B-LOC
. O

It O
's O
like O
coup- O
you O
know O
, O
f- O
our O
country O
's O
a O
couple O
hundred O
years O
old O
, O
we O
got O
a O
couple O
of O
gripes O
going O
back O
to O
, O
you O
know O
, O
what O
, O
seventeen O
seventy O
six O
, O
Marco O
Yeah O
. O

Mike O
there O
it O
goes O
, O
you O
know O
, O
thous- O
it O
's O
like O
the O
Hatfields O
and O
the O
McCoys O
. O

They O
're O
fi- O
they O
do O
n't O
even O
know O
why O
they O
're O
fighting O
anymore O
. O

They O
just O
they O
hate O
each O
other O
-- O
and O
they O
're O
always O
going O
to O
hate O
each O
other O
-- O
and O
it O
does O
n't O
matter O
who O
started O
it O
, O
but O
-- O
i- O
you O
know O
, O
somebody O
eh O
, O
th- O
somebody O
's O
in O
always O
intent O
on O
winning O
. O

And O
it O
's O
and O
it O
's O
it O
's O
you O
know O
, O
a O
war O
of O
attrition O
. O

Nobody O
wins O
. O

It O
's O
either O
, O
you O
know O
, O
you O
may O
kill O
me O
, O
but O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
kill O
all O
of O
you O
before- O
y- O
you O
know O
what O
I O
mean O
? O

It O
's O
just O
i- O
i- O
it O
's O
stupid O
. O

The O
whole O
thing O
's O
stupid O
. O

And O
a O
guy O
like O
Yasser O
Arafat O
, O
Marco O
Yeah O
. O

Yeah O
. O

Mike O
he O
was O
a O
terrorist O
. O

In O
in O
the O
sixties O
-- O
in O
the O
mid O
sixties O
an- O
and O
and O
a- O
you O
know O
, O
on O
into- O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
through O
the O
mid O
eighties O
-- O
the O
guy O
was O
a O
terrorist O
. O

Marco O
So O
, O
let O
us O
let O
us O
not O
forget O
that O
when O
Israel B-LOC
was O
-- O
formed O
-- O
and O
they O
were O
, O
um O
, O
the O
-- O
the O
Israelis B-LOC
for O
not O
feeling O
-- O
like O
they O
had O
a O
legitimate O
-- O
right O
-- O
some O
of O
the O
land O
or O
that O
-- O
land O
was O
n't O
, O
um O
, O
rightfully O
theirs O
. O

There O
were O
-- O
two O
very O
strong O
-- O
militant O
groups O
that O
were O
Israeli B-LOC
and O
they O
-- O
committed O
a O
lot O
of O
terrorist O
acts O
, O
Mike O
Oh O
, O
the O
yeah O
, O
the O
Zionists B-ORG
. O

Abso- O
absolutely O
. O

Marco O
much O
-- O
Yeah O
. O

So O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
i- O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
uh O
, O
how O
we O
consider O
-- O
Arafat O
a O
terrorist O
, O
we O
also O
should O
consider O
that O

could O

a O
reaction O
to O
some O
of O
the O

that O

Mike O
Absolutely O

I O

not O
believe O

I O
'm O
not O
I O
'm O
not O
excusing O

anybody O
-- O
but O
for O
the O
purpose O
I O
I O
mean O
, O
the O
way O
I O
see O
it O
is O
you O
know O
, O
I O
guess O
for O
the O
purposes O
of O
the O
conversation O
th- O
-- O
that O
they O
want O
to O
hear O
, O
Marco O
Yeah O
. O

Mike O
y- O
you O
got O
to O
kind O
of O
have O
to O
put O
that O
as O
y- O
-- O
i- O
it O
's O
kind O
of O
like O
-- O
do O
if O
that O
's O
the O
case O
, O
do O
two O
wrongs O
really O
make O
a O
right O
? O

You O
know O
what O
I O
mean O
? O

Marco O
But O
if O
Arafat O
had O
n't O
been O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
he O
's O
-- O
directly O
-- O
been O
linked O
to O
Hamas B-ORG
' O
acts O
, O
uh O
, O
but O
he O
was O
put O
in O
a O
-- O
pretty O
-- O
sticky O
situation O
having O
to O
negotiate O
-- O
the O
militants O
of O
-- O
Palestine B-LOC
-- O
the O
international O
leaders O
-- O
and O
if O
it O
if O
Hara- O
Arafat O
had O
n't O
-- O
somehow O
appeased O
-- O
the O
Hamas B-ORG
groups O
or O
the O
Palestinian B-LOC
militants O
, O
then O
-- O
he O
would O
've O
been O
kicked O
out O
, O
overthrown O
-- O
by- O
-- O
by O
the O
Palestinians O
. O

Mike O
Oh O
, O
forget O
about O
kicked O
out O
or O
overthrown O
, O
he O
would O
've O
been O
killed O
. O

That's-that O
's O
how O
it O
works O
over O
there O
. O

Marco O
Yeah O
. O

Yeah O
. O

Exactly O
. O

Well O
, O
it O
it O
's O
not O
really O
Arafat O
-- O
as O
an O
individual O
, O
I O
think O
it O
's O
just O
-- O
whatever O
leader O
-- O
is O
-- O
placed O
in O
the O
position O
of- O
Mike O
He O
was O
he O
was O
basically O

I O

I O
've O

I O
've O
read O
articles O
an- O

that O
basically O
have O
linked O
him O
to O
the O
to O
the O

the O

th- O
you O

the O
Munich B-LOC
Olympic O
massacre O
th- O
the O
Is- O
the O
Israeli B-LOC

It- O

the O
the O
problem O
is O
-- O
what O
he O
did O

back O
way O
back O
when O
Marco O
Uh-huh O

Mike O
will O
-- O
f- O
forever O
tarnish O
anything O
that O
he O
did O
-- O
in O
his O
later O
years O
. O

Like O
like O
you O
said O
, O
bringing O
the O
groups O
together O
but O
the O
reason O
that O
he O
was O
able O
to O
bring O

is O
because O

one O

it O
have O

something O

What O
do O

Should O

Joe O
So O
, O
uh O
, O
what O
do O
you O
think O
about O
Arafat O
? O

James O
Well O
-- O
I O
, O
uh O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
there O
was O
anything O
malicious O
, O
uh O
, O
in O
terms O
of O
his O
death O
-- O
uh O
, O
just O
looking O
at O
him O
these O
last O
, O
uh O
, O
couple O
of O
years O
uh O
, O
it O
seems O
like O
he O
had O
Alzheimer O
's O
or O
something O
. O

Joe O
Yeah O
, O
he O
has O
been O
getting O
older O
. O

James O
Yeah O
, O
because O
he O
was O
quivering O
at O
the O
mouth O
and O
and O
hands O
were O
shaking O
. O

And O
-- O
I O
would O
imagine O
that O
living O
in O
that O
compound O
couldn't O
have O
been O
that O
conducive O
to O
his O
health O
. O

Joe O
Yeah O
, O
he O
probably O
should O
have O
been O
in O
a O
hospital O
or O
a O
hospice O
or O
James O
Right O
. O

Joe O
you O
know O
, O
if O
it O
was O
that O
bad O
. O

James O
Right O
. O

Right O
, O
I O
'm O
sure O
that O
they O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
about O
, O
bout O
-- O
the O
uh O
sanitary O
conditions O
there O
, O
but O
-- O
I O
I O
just O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
could O
have O
been O
, O
uh O
, O
conducive O
to O
his O
health O
. O

And O
as O
far O
as O
, O
uh O
, O

, O
uh O
, O
allowing O
-- O
him O
to O
be O

uh O
, O
in O

Joe O
That O
's O
accept O
James O
huh O
? O

Joe O
That O
's O
acceptable O
to O
me O
. O

I O
mean O
James O
Well O
, O
it O
, O
it O
's O
acceptable O
to O
me O
, O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
was O
feasible O
. O

Joe O
feasible O
James O
Yeah O
, O
given O
the O
circumstance O
in O
that O
area O
right O
now O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
even O
know O
if O
they O
would O
have O
been O
able O
to O
pull O
it O
off O
, O
you O
know O
? O

Joe O
Well O
, O
uh O
, O
so O
he O
, O
in O
fact O
he O
wasn't O
James O
Pardon O
me O
? O

Joe O
so O
, O
um O
-- O
no O
, O
so O
he O
was O
n't O
buried O
in O
Jerusalem B-LOC
. O

James O
No O
. O

No O
, O
they O
buried O
him O
-- O
uh O
, O
inside O
that O
compound O
. O

Joe O
Oh O
, O
I O
see O
. O

James O
Yeah O
, O
they O
buried O
him O
inside O
that O
compound O
. O

But O
like O
you O
say O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
-- O
I O
personally O
-- O
uh O
-- O
would O
n't O
have O
seen O
a O
problem O
with O
it O
, O
but O
-- O
I O
just O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
was O
feasible O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
that O
they O
would O
have O
been O
-- O
uh O
, O
secure O
enough O
to O
really O
do O
it O
. O

I O
don't O
think O
either O
side O
would O
have O
really O
-- O
let O
it O
happen O
-- O
and O
-- O
and O
as O
far O
as O
a O
senior O
U.S B-LOC
. O

official O
going O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
that O
would O
have O
been O
necessary O
either O
. O

Um O
, O
I O
know O
President O
Bush O
should O
n't O
have O
went O
-- O
and O
he O
was O
n't O
going O
. O

Joe O
Well O
, O
I O
kind O
of O
feel O
, O
I O
kind O
of O
feel O
another O
way O
. O

I O
think O
a O
senior O
U.S B-LOC
. O

service O
in O
there O
, O
should O
have O
been O
there O
, O
because O
I O
mean O
-- O
he O
, O
Arafat O
's O
been O
-- O
been O
the O
one O
coming O
to O
all O
these O
peace O
talks O
, O
you O
know O
, O
with O
President O
Clinton O
and O
, O
you O
know O
, O
other O
James O
Mhm O
. O

Joe O
other O
um O
-- O
litigations O
towards O
that O
. O

James O
Mhm O
. O

Joe O
You O
know O
, O
I O
think O
, O
I O
think O
we O
could O
have O
just O
showed O
our O
face O
and O
said O
you O
know O
, O
yeah O
, O
we O
do O
recognize O
this O
man O
. O

James O
Mhm O
. O

Well O
it O
, O
they O
sent O
someone O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
who O
it O
was O
-- O
( O
( O
It O
was O
n't O
) O
) O
Joe O
It O
probably O
, O
it O
was O
n't O
anybody O
important O
. O

It O
was O
just O
like O
a O
James O
Yeah O
it O
was O
an O
under O
secretary O
, O
there O
's O
no O
doubt O
about O
it O
. O

There O
was O
no O
senior O
Joe O
James O
there O
was O
no O
senior O
U.S B-LOC
. O

official O
there O
. O

There O
's O
there O
's O
no O
question O
about O
that O
. O

Joe O
Yeah O
. O

James O
But O
, O
uh O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
uh O
, O
Bush O
's O
policy O
-- O
towards O
, O
uh O
, O
Yasser O
Arafat O
has O
been O
hands O
off O
Joe O
Yeah O
. O

James O
from O
from O
the O
beginning O
cause O
I O
do O
n't O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
he O
ever O
even O
met O
with O
him O
. O

Did O
he O
? O

Joe O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
so O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
so O
. O

James O
Yeah O
, O
I O
I O
Joe O
Bush O
is O
kind O
of O
like O
, O
staying O
away O
from O
the O
whole O
Israel B-LOC
-- O
Palestinian B-LOC
James O
Mhm O
. O

Now O
on O
his O
part O
I O
think O
that O
was O
a O
mistake O
. O

Joe O
Yeah O
. O

James O
Yeah O
, O
you O
know O
you O
got O
to O
engage O
people O
in O
some O
type O
of O
dialogue O
Joe O
And O
James O
if O
you O
Joe O
to O
me O
, O
the O
talk O
, O
the O
peace O
talks O
should O
have O
continued O
-- O
after O
Clinton O
's O
administration O
left O
. O

James O
True O
. O

Joe O
Cause O
at O
the O
cause O
at O
the O
end O
Clinton O
was O
doing O
all O
this O
peace O
talk O
with O
Arafat O
and O
, O
um O
James O
True O
. O

Mhm O
. O

Joe O
( O
( O
forget O
) O
) O
the O
um O
, O
prime O
minister O
in O
Israel B-LOC
, O
but O
he O
was O
talking O
to O
him O
. O

James O
Uh O
, O
Sharon O
. O

Joe O
Sharon O
, O
yeah O
. O

James O
Yeah O
. O

Mhm O
. O

Joe O
They O
were O
doing O
all O
these O
talks O
in O
Camp O
David O
and O
and O
it O
should O
have O
just O
continued O
when O
Br- O
Bush O
came O
into O
office O
. O

James O
You O
're O
absolutely O
right O
. O

I O
agree O
. O

Like O
I O
said O
, O
I O
think O
that O
was O
one O
of O
Bush O
's O
biggest O
mistakes O
, O
Joe O
Mhm O
. O

James O
not O
continuing O
-- O
the O
talks O
. O

Because O
Clinton O
had O
came O
so O
very O
close O
Joe O
Yes O
. O

James O
to O
to O
maybe O
getting O
some O
type O
of O
agreement O
Joe O
No O
. O

James O
but O
, O
uh O
, O
Bush O
just O
took O
a O
hands O
off O
approach O
. O

He O
just O
-- O
kind O
of O
took O
a O
hands O
off O
approach O
. O

Joe O
And O
now O
the O
situation O
in O
, O
you O
know O
, O
Jerusalem B-LOC
and O
the O
West B-LOC
Bank I-LOC
is O
just O
-- O
escalated O
. O

James O
Absolutely O
. O

And O
I O
think O
too O
-- O
Israel B-LOC
's O
-- O
position O
toward O
Arafat O
-- O
in O
terms O
of O
keeping O
him O
sort O
of O
like O
-- O
uh O
-- O
surrounded O
in O
that O
compound O
-- O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
that O
was O
a O
good O
idea O
. O

Joe O
No O
. O

James O
You O
know O
, O
because O
that O
, O
you O
ca O
n't O
pick O
a O
leader O
for O
a O
people O
. O

Whether O
you O
like O
them O
or O
not O
-- O
people O
get O
to O
choose O
who O
they O
want O
to O
follow O
, O
Joe O
Exactly O
. O

James O
and O
the O
Palestinians B-LOC
had O
made O
it O
clear O
-- O
that O
Arafat O
was O
their O
leader O
. O

Joe O
Exactly O
. O

James O
So O
, O
I O
think O
that O
they O
, O
we O
should O
have O
found O
a O
way O
-- O
Israel B-LOC
should O
have O
found O
a O
way O
-- O
to O
-- O
keep O
some O
type O
of O
dialogue O
-- O
going O
along O
. O

Cause O
uh O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
you O
look O
at O
what O
's O
going O
on O
now O
. O

Joe O
Mhm O
. O

James O
I O
mean O
, O
their O
policy O
toward O
him O
did O
n't O
get O
them O
anything O
. O

And O
then O
you O
got O
suicide O
bombing O
on O
the O
one O
side O
, O
and O
then O
you O
got O
Israel B-LOC

you O
know O
, O
it O
's O
like O
one O
day O
, O
you O
'll O
he- O
a O
bomb O
will O
go O
off O
, O
the O
next O
day O
Israel B-LOC
will O
do O
and O
air O
strike O
and O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
it O
's O
like O
going O
around O
in O
a O
circle O

Joe O
Yeah O
. O

James O
It O
's O
like O
going O
around O
in O

Joe O
It O
's O
really O

bad O

James O
It O

It O

and O
it O

, O
it O

been O

long O
-- O
going O

I O

you're O

with O
about O
six O
different O
clients O
trying O

we're O
going O
to O
do O
. O

Ed O
( O
( O
Allan O
) O
) O
-- O
Well O
, O
that O
's O
not O
bad O
. O

That O
means O
that O
you O
've O
got O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
to O
see O
and O
do O
things O
with O
. O

That O
's O
good O
. O

Jane O
Yeah O
, O
makes O
it O
kind O
of O
hectic O
. O

How O

Ed O
Ah O

're O
going O
to O
be O
doing O
, O
uh O
, O
the O
typical O
. O

Go O
up O
and O
celebrate O
with O
the O
family O
and O
-- O
be O
with O
the O
little O
kids O
. O

You O
know O
, O
the O
( O
( O
tough O
years O
) O
) O
and O
that O
which O
makes O
it O
-- O
because O
when O
you O
get O
older O
it O
's O
kind O
of O
, O
I O
've O
got O
all O
the O
gifts O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
need O
that O
. O

What O
I O
really O
want O
to O
do O
is O
see O
somebody O
else O
enjoy O
it O
and O
the O
little O
kids O
enjoy O
it O
. O

So- O
-- O
and O
, O
uh O
, O
do O
a O
lot O
of O
parties O
with O
family O
-- O
and O
friends O
. O

Jane O
Well O
, O
that O
's O
kind O
of O
where- O
we O
're O
in O
between O
which O
family O
we O
're O
going O
to O
see O
and O
when O
and O
how O
and O
get O
all O
that O
worked O
out O
. O

Ed O
Uh O
, O
Jane O
Ed O
so O
whoev- O
yeah O
, O
I O
've O
seen O
them- O
-- O
just O
not O
the O
gifts O
it O
comes O
down O
to O
the O
food O
. O

See O
, O
now O
you O
( O
( O
) O
) O
. O

Jane O
There O
you O
go O
. O

I- O
one O
of O
these O
choices O
is O
meat O
cooking O
. O

We O
'll O
have O
to O
put O
that O
towards O
the O
end O
. O

Ed O
( O
( O
Ah O
, O
oui O
. O
) O
) O

-- O
Eh O
, O
( O
( O
nice O
) O
) O
. O

So O
we- O
we O
've O
only- O
Jane O
Ed O
my O
family O
's O
, O
uh O
, O
parents O
are O
deceased O
and O
most O
of O
( O
( O
them O
) O
) O
is O
, O
uh O
, O
passed O
my O
brothers O
all O
over O
, O
so O
her O
family O
's O
still O
younger O
-- O
and O
, O
uh O
, O
you O
know O
, O
just O
the O
odd O
sides O
. O

She O
's O
the O
oldest O
and O
I O
'm O
the O
youngest O
, O
so O
she O
's O
got O
younger O
which O
-- O
keeps O
the O
thing O
going O
, O
so O
I- O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
my O
view O
is O
-- O
( O
( O
stay O
) O
) O
with O
the O
family O
go O
visit O
the O
family O
. O

That O
's O
all O
you O
got O
. O

So O
-- O
keep O
it O
together O
through O
thick O
and O
thin O
and O
-- O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
Thanksgiving O
we O
go O
up O
there O
and O
we O
celebrate O
. O

And O
then O
there's O
little O
parties O
. O

Big- O
uh O
, O
her O
sister O
does O
a O
big O
family O
party O
-- O
but O
try O
to O
keep O
that O
same O
Jane O
Ed O
local O
family O
coming O
together O
. O

It O
's O
amazing O
how O
they O
can O
get O
into O
little O
squabbles O
and O
who O
does O
n't O
show O
up O
Jane O
Of O
course O
. O

Ed O
like O
that O
. O

I O
think O
it O
's O
crazy O
. O

So O
, O
( O
( O
so O
, O
uh O
) O
) O
- O
Jane O
They O
used O
to O
always O
really O
all O
get O
together O
. O

but O
his O
parents O
uh O
they O
actually O
live O
next O
door O
to O
us O
. O

but O
they O
're O
starting O
to O
get O
up O
in O
the O
years O
, O
so O
they O
're O
not O
, O
you O
know O
, O
hosting O
the O
big O
parties O
, O
so O
it's O
funny O
how O
now O
people O
do O
n't O
all O
bother O
to O
come O
Ed O
Yeah O
. O

Jane O
and O
you O
kind O
of O
wonder O
you O
know O
in O
the O
next O
couple O
of O
years O
what O
's O
all O
going O
to O
happen O
. O

Are O
they O
all O
going O
to O
see O
each O
other O
. O

Ed O
Yeah O
, O
no O
that's- O
that O
's O
exactly O
. O

I O
've O
already O
seen O
, O
you O
know O
, O
( O
( O
in O
) O
) O
my O
parents O
( O
( O
' O
bed O
) O
) O
until O
they O
( O
( O
got O
) O
) O
less O
and O
less O
that O
the O
brothers O
got O
together O
-- O
and O
then O
now O
when O
there O
's O
an O
event O
you O
try O
to O
do O
it O
. O

At O
Christmas O
it O
's O
just O
impossible O
because O
we O
leave O
-- O
two O
days O
after O
Christmas O
Jane O
Mhm O
. O

Ed O
to O
go O
out O
of O
the O
country O
as O
part O
of O
our O
New O
Year's O
Jane O
Ed O
celebration O
. O

So O
, O
for O
us O
it O
's O
, O
you O
know O
, O
got O
to O
be O
a O
quick O
trip O
up O
Jane O
Ed O
to O
her O
family O
and O
then O
back O
where O
we- O
-- O
we O
've O
been O
invited O
to O
be O
down O
in O
Jane O
Ed O
another O
country O
. O

If O
a O
person O
is O
not- O
even O
though O
it O
's O
cold O
up O
in O
the O
Northeast O
, O
it O
's O
a O
family O
tradition O
. O

I O
should O
do O
it O
-- O
and O
less O
for O
the O
gifts O
and O
more O
for O
Jane O
Ed O
being O
together O
. O

Yeah O
. O

Jane O
Well O
, O
we O
did- O
-- O
-for O
the O
kids O
you O
know O
we O
made O
it O
pretty O
cl- O
Ed O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
I O
think O
that O
's O
great O
. O

Jane O
-you O
know O
, O
you O
did O
n't O
have O
all O
the O
hassle O
of O
running O
around O
and O
being O
crazy O
and O
just O
kind O
of O
spent O
time O
together O
Ed O
And O
I O
think O
that O
's O
very- O
I O
mean O
, O
if- O
Jane O
and O
it O
was O
really O
pretty O
nice O
. O

Ed O
Yeah O
, O
we O
haven't- O
-- O
yeah O
, O
I O
think O
-- O
e- O
e- O
eventually O
that O
may O
happen O
, O
the O
way O
we O
're O
going O
with O
, O
uh O
, O
Jane O
Ed O
my O
wife O
and O
I O
with O
her O
Jane O
Ed O
family O
. O

Not O
as O
a O
negative O
but O
as O
a- O
Jane O
Ed O
you O
know O
, O
we O
do O
a O
lot O
of O
traveling O
so O
that O
's O
going O
to O
be- O
I O
think O
that O
's O
going O
to O
come O
up O
. O

Jane O
Ed O
But- O
-- O
but O
for O
now O
we O
're O
still O
trying O
to O
do- O
Jane O
Ed O
as O
long O
as O
the O
mother O
's O
around O
, O
we O
'll O
still O
do O
Christmas O
and O
act O
as- O
Jane O
Ed O
she O
is O
not O
really O
old O
, O
but O
she O
's O
getting O
older O
, O
so O
I O
think O
that O
's O
one O
reason O
to O
stay O
together O
Jane O
Ed O
and O
also O
I O
think O
i- O
is O
Jane O
Ed O
eh O
, O
we- O
we O
kind O
of O
-- O
infused O
a O
little O
family O
party O
that O
her O
sister O
has O
so O
-- O
I O
think O
if O
we O
were O
to O
go O
away O
both O
of O
those O
might O
fall O
off O
a O
little O
bit O
and O
it O
does O
n't O
take O
but O
one O
year O
and O
then O
all O
of O
the O
sudden O
everybody's O
Jane O
Yeah O
. O

Ed O
not O
coming O
to O
it O
anymore O
and O
it O
's O
like O
a- O
Jane O
That O
's O
it O
. O

That O
's O
the O
way O
it O
is O
. O

Ed O
Yeah O
, O
but O
not O
because- O
Jane O
If O
I O
'm O
no- O
Ed O
it O
is- O
-- O
I- O
I O
enjoy O
the O
-- O
smiling O
people O
and O
the O
festive- O
-- O
festive O
nature O
and O
-- O
I O
think O
it O
does O
get O
a O
little O
commercialized O
. O

( O
( O
It O
's O
not O
that O
the- O
) O
) O
-- O
You O
can O
ignore O
that O
part O
of O
it O
, O
I O
guess O
. O

Deirdre O

a O
church O
service O
? O

Ryan O
Um O
, O
actually O
, O
usually O

're O
out O
of O
town O
so O
we O
do O
n't O
attend O
our O
church O
. O

Deirdre O
So O

go O
with O
, O
um O
, O
family O
, O
friends O
? O

Ryan O
Family O

yeah O

Deirdre O
Family O
? O

Ryan O
It O
's O
almost O
always O
my O
grandma O
. O

Deirdre O
Your O
gran- O
you O
go O
to O
your O
grandma O
's O
house O
. O

Ryan O
Mhm O
. O

Deirdre O
Yeah O
, O
that O
's O
what O
we O
do O
. O

Every O
year O
, O
uh O
, O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
always O
attend O
. O

Uh O
, O
my O
family O
-- O
celebrates O
the O
sun O
shining O
. O

They O
're O
always O
together O
. O

So O
, O
uh O
, O
it O
's O
not O
particularly O
special O
at O
Christmas O
-- O
because O
they O
see O
each O
other O
every O
other O
weekend O
. O

But O
, O
still O
, O
uh O
, O
they O
go O
to O
, O
uh O
, O
grandmother O
's O
-- O
every O
Christmas O
. O

A O
particular O
person O
's O
house O
every O
holiday O
season O
. O

You O
know O
, O
whether O
it O
's O
Christmas O
or O
-- O
Thanksgiving O
or O
Mother O
's O
Day O
or O
Easter O
, O
it O
just O
alternates O
it- O
you O
know O
, O
each- O
uh O
, O
a O
particular O
person O
's O
house O
is- O
is O
how O
they O
do O
it O
. O

Ryan O
Oh O
. O

Deirdre O
I O
just O
do O
n't O
always O
attend O
. O

Just- O
-- O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
it's- O
-- O
there O
's O
just O
so O
much O
of O
my O
family O
I O
can O
take O
during O
one O
year O
, O
you O
know O
, O
but- O
Ryan O
Well O
, O
um O
, O
since O
they O
see O
each O
other O
so O
much O
, O
is O
there O
anything O
that O
does O
make O
it O
special O
? O

Deirdre O
Well O
, O
I O
guess O
they O
seem O
to O
think O
it O
's O
just O
special O
because O
-- O
everyone O
comes O
. O

I- O
I- O
it's- O
-- O
it O
's O
just O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
old O
. O

Y- O
you O
know O
, O
it's- O
it O
's O
not- O
-- O
it O
's O
not O
special O
to O
me O
because O
they O
do O
it O
all O
the O
time O
. O

You O
know O
, O
special O
would O
make O
it O
, O
I O
only O
see O
you O
once O
a O
year O
. O

It O
's O
just O
not- O
it O
's O
just O
not O
special O
if O
I O
see O
you O
every O
other O
month O
. O

Ryan O
Yeah O
. O

Deirdre O
You O
know O
, O
it O
's O
just O
not O
. O

I O
mean O
, O
you O
know O
, O
not O
like O
, O
you O
're O
seeing O
your O
mother O
-- O
or O
your O
sister O
, O
maybe O
your O
brothers O
, O
you O
know O
, O
you- O
you O
might- O
you O
may O
see O
them O
all O
the O
time O
, O
but O
when O
you O
see O
your O
aunts O
and O
uncles O
and O
all O
your O
cousins O
-- O
all O
the O
time O
, O
where O
's O
the O
break O
here O
? O

But O
, O
you O
know O
, O
they O
like- O
I O
do O
n't O
particularly O
care O
for O
it O
, O
but O
they O
like O
it O
. O

I O
did O
attend O
Thanksgiving O
and O
Ryan O
Huh O
. O

Deirdre O
that O
was O
nice O
. O

Um O
, O
uh O
, O
it O
was- O
it O
was O
a O
good O
day O
. O

Uh O
, O
but O
, O
you O
know O
, O
we- O
we O
-- O
spend O
all O
day O
together O
. O

It O
's O
not O
like O
you O
just O
go O
and O
eat O
dinner O
a O
couple O
of O
hours O
and O
go O
home O
. O

You O
go O
and O
you O
stay O
twelve O
hours O
-- O
because O
most O
of O
my O
relatives O
live O
within O
thirty O
minutes O
of O
each O
other O
, O
Ryan O
( O
( O
Ye- O
) O
) O
Deirdre O
so O
it O
's O
easy O
. O

Ryan O
Oh O
, O
wow O
. O

Deirdre O
Yeah O
. O

It O
's O
easy O
just O
to O
go O
to O
someone O
's O
house O
. O

Ryan O
Well O
, O
sounds O
a O
lot O
like O
my O
mom O
's O
side O
of O
the O
family O
because O
they're O
all O
in O
one O
city O
except O
for O
Deirdre O
And- O
Ryan O
except O
for O
her O
and O
, O
uh O
, O
us O
. O

Deirdre O
Well O
, O
would O
you O
rather O
be O
with O
everyone O
else O
or O
do O
you O
like O
it O
-- O
away O
. O

Ryan O
I O
think O
I O
would O
rather O
be O
, O
but O
then O
again O
-- O
I O
talk O
to O
my O
cousin O
and O
I'm O
always O
asking O
her O
how O
my O
other O
cousins O
are O
doing O
and O
-- O
she O
hardly O
knows O
because O
she O
has- O
hardly O
sees O
them O
every O
day O
. O

Deirdre O
Oh O
. O

What O
the O
hell O

they O
appreciating O

a O
little O
more O
. O

B O
Yeah O
yeah O
yeah O
. O

Exactly O
, O
because O
they O
really O
do O
n't O
. O

I O
mean O
, O
they O
look O
at O
us O
as O
-- O
the O
parties O
that O
are O
causing O
problems O
, O
look O
at O
us O
as O
we're O
very O
corrupt O
. O

You O
have O
to O
remember O
, O
religion-wise O
, O
A O
Yep O
. O

B O
how O
they O
are O
. O

What- O
they O
way O
we O
live O
is O
just O
-- O
totally O
against O
they're O
religion O
. O

A O
And O
that O
's O
, O
eh O
, O
they- O
the O
way O
they O
live O
is O
just O
so O
weird O
anyways O
, O
you O
know O
, O
it O
's O
just- O
B O
Yeah O
. O

Yeah O
, O
but O
they O
think O
of O
us O
as O
weird O
. O

( O
( O
Hold O
on O
Jen O
. O
) O
) O

You O
know O
, O
so O
, O
you O
just O
, O
uh O
, O
A O
Exactly O
. O

I O
, O
uh- O
B O
everybody O
's O
got O
their O
own O
way O
of O
, O
you O
know O
, O
thinking O
and- O
and O
they O
do O
n't O
want O
-- O
the O
biggest O
problem O
is- O
is O
-- O
we O
're O
pushing O
ourselves O
on O
them O
, O
you O
know O
. O

They O
're O
not O
pushing O
their O
religion O
on O
us O
. O

A O
Exactly O
. O

Exactly O
. O

B O
You O
know O
, O
and O
so O
-- O
I- O
I O
guess O
-- O
I O
would O
have O
a O
problem O
if O
someone O
was O
shoving O
something O
down O
my O
throat O
, O
you O
know O
, O
saying O
, O
this O
is O
how O
it O
should O
be O

and O
that O
's O
how O
we're- O
we O
are O
. O

We're O
going O
over O
there O

're O
saying O
, O
look O
, O
this O
is O
how O
we O
do O
it O
-- O
and O
, O
um O
, O
i- O
-- O
so O

think O
everybody O
else O
should O
be O
that O
way O
. O

A O

about O

there're O
some O
people O
that O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
go O
. O

Tom O
Yeah O
. O

Joe O
You O
know O
, O
so O
, O
but O
it's- O
it O
's O
kind O
of O
a O
scary O
thing O
and O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
is O
doing O
the O
right O
thing O

I O
-- O
do O
n't O
think O
so O
. O

Joe O
I- O
I O
kind O
of O
lean- O
Tom O
Uh O
, O
I O
think- O
-- O
I O
think O
Bush O
-- O
is O
, O
uh O
, O
trying O
to O
-- O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
his O
his O
dad O
-- O
pulled O
everybody O
out O
when O
they O
just O
, O
uh O
, O
kicked O
-- O
people O
out O
of O

Joe O
Kuwait B-LOC
. O

Tom O
Kuwait B-LOC
. O

Joe O
Yep O

Tom O
Okay O

he O
wants O

comes O
back O

Joe O
Yeah O
, O
he O
wants O
to O
finish O
the O
job O
that O
his O
father O
Tom O
That O
's O
what O
I O
think O
. O

Joe O
started O
, O
pretty O
much O
. O

That O
's O
why O
his O
father O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
invade O
Iraq B-LOC
, O
because O
of O
all O
these O
problems O
they O
're O
having O
now O
. O

He O
knew O
that O
there O
was O
going O
to O
be O
-- O
look O
at O
all O
these O
insurgents O
. O

Look O
at O
what O
happened O

, O
Allan O

Do O
you O

Allan O
Yeah O
, O
I O
think O
the O
-- O
I O
think O
they O
're O
still O
they O
're O
going O
to O
go O
through O
even O
though O
, O
uh O
, O
even O
though O
, O
um O
, O
what O
's O
it O
called O

that O
you O

all O
the O

that O
's O
happening O
there O

all O
of O
the O
argu- O
you O
know O
, O
and O
all O
the O
-- O

everything O
. O

I O
think O
it O
'll O
still O
go O
through O
, O
you O
know O
. O

The O
-- O
it O
's O
democracy O
, O
you O
know O
, O
you O
have O
to O
fight O
for O
it O

It O
's O
not O
-- O
it O
does O
n't O
come O
easily O
, O
you O
know O
. O

A O
Right O
. O

Yeah O
, O
that O
's O
why O
I O
think O
it O
will O
, O
too O
, O
because O
they- O
they O
pushed O
it O
in O
Iraq B-LOC

I O
mean O
, O
uh O
, O
excuse O
me O
, O
in O
Afghanistan B-LOC

They O
kept O
on O

them O
and O
they O
we O
're O
saying O
, O
oh O
, O
no O
no O
no O
, O
you O
know O
. O

Allan O
Um O
, O
yeah O
, O
I O
think O
-- O
you O
know O
I O
think O
they O
should O
have O
continued O
to O
go O
through O
with O
it O
, O
and O
you O
know O
um O
-- O
if- O
if O
there O
is O
-- O
if O
there's O
problems O
, O
you O
know O
, O
just O
-- O
still O
-- O
do O
n't O
, O
you O
know O
-- O
just O
ignore O
it O
, O
keep O
going O
, O
you O
know O
you O
ca O
n't O
-- O
stop O
, O
you O
know O
, O
if O
you O
already O
started O
something O
, O
you O
know O
, O
you O
should O
complete O
it O
, O
I O
think O
. O

A O
Right O
. O

Allan O
I O
mean O
, O
if O
they O
leave O
-- O
if O
they O
leave O
, O
you O
know O
, O
if O
the- O
eh O
, O
let's O
say O
they O
, O
you O
know O
, O
they O
just O
leave O
right O
now O
, O
you O
know O
, O
the O
the O
-- O
they O
ca O
n't O
, O
you O
know O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
the O
-- O
the O
-- O
the O
occupants O
themselves O
regain O
control O
and O
, O
you O
know O
, O
and O
mo- O
and O
, O
you O
know O
, O
and O
-- O
put O
down O
the O
power O
and O
, O
you O
know O
, O
an- O
and O
control O
everything O
they O
can O
. O

They O
just O
need O
they O
, O
you O
know O
, O
they O
need O
assistance O
and O
to O
get O
off O
-- O
get O
off O
, O
you O
know O
, O
on O
the O
right O
step O
. O

I O
think O
they O
're O
going O
to O
need O
the O
military O
to O
be O
in O
there O
. O

And O
assist O
them O
with O
the O
elections O
and O
they O
need O
to O
complete O
the O
elections O
and O
all O
this O
. O

A O
Yeah O
, O
um O
, O
yeah O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
the O
end O
game O
, O
per O
se O
, O
is O
going O
to O
be O
there O
, O
you O
know O
, O
because O
, O
eh O
, O
they- O
the O
problem O
is O
the- O
is O
the O
culture O
, O
you O
know O
, O
it O
's O
-- O
pretty O
, O
uh O
, O
you O
know O
, O
it O
's O
really O
almost O
like O
a O
modern O
day O
Crusades O
, O
you O
know O
, O
and O
that's- O
that O
's O
kind O
of O
hard O
, O
you O
know O
. O

A O
lot O
of O
-- O
there O
's O
a O
lot O
of O
embitterment O
that O
goes O
back O
generations O
and O
stuff O
, O
so O
, O
you O
know O
, O
we O
have O
-- O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
I O
always O
think O
we O
have O
such O
a O
short O
mindset O
, O
uh O
, O
but O
they O
do O
n't O
. O

So O
, O
that O
's O
why O
, O
uh O
, O
I- O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
i- O
There O
's O
always O
going O
to O
be O
problems O
there O
, O
I O
just O
do O
n't O
-- O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
long O
we O
should O
-- O
be O
in O
Iraq B-LOC
. O

I O
mean O
, O
definitely O
to O
keep O
it O
stable O
. O

I- O
-- O
eh O
, O
I O
just O
-- O
I- O
I O
think O
the O
situation O
could O
be O
handled O
better O
. O

I- O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
a O
great O
idea O
fir- O
them O
going O
in O
there O
-- O
and O
doing O
what O
they O
did O
but O
, O
uh O
, O
they O
had O
a O
short O
window O
of O
opportunity O
to O
win O
over O
the O
people O
and O
it O
did O
n't O
happen O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
that O
was O
just O
out O
of O
our O
control O
or- O
or O
what O
or O
if O
we O
could O
've O
done O
a O
better O
job O
but O
, O
uh O
, O
you O
know O
. O

Allan O
Do O
you O
support O
the O
-- O
do O
you- O
do O
you O
support O
the O
war O
? O

A O
What O
's O
that O
now O
? O

Allan O
Do O
you O
support O
the O
war O
? O

A O
Yeah O
. O

Yeah O
, O
I O
did O
at O
first O
I O
just- O
I O
just O
-- O
I O
-- O
do O
n't O
like O
the O
way O
it O
was O
managed O
. O

I O
think O
-- O
I O
think O
, O
uh O
, O
they O
did O
a O
great O
job O
up O
front O
, O
of O
course O
. O

You O
know O
, O
they O
did O
militarily-wise O
, O
they O
did O
an O
excellent O
job O
but O
I O
think O
they O
've O
done O
a O
poor O
job O
, O
you O
know O
, O
reconstructing O
and O
just O
controlling O
the O
situation O
. O

You O
know O
, O
they- O
Allan O
Yeah O
, O
I- O
I O
agree O
also O
. O

Yeah O
, O
I- O
I O
mean O
, O
I- O
I O
did O
support O
the O
war O
. O

I O
just O
think O
that O
when O
they O
went O
in O
there O
, O
you O
know O
they O
-- O
they O
just O
did O
n't O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
they O
did O
n't O
i- O
execute O
everything O
correctly O
, O
you O
know O
there O
was O
problems O
, O
you O
know O
. O

A O
Yeah O
. O

Allan O
And O
I O
think O
I O
mean O
, O
that O
that O
lead O
to O
it O
, O
but O
yeah O
, O
I O
mean O
they O
-- O
I O
mean O
eh O
you O
know O
you O
're O
already O
in O
it O
, O
so O
you O
know O
, O
you O
should O
n't O
-- O
you O
ca O
n't O
just O
walk O
down O
and O
, O
you O
know O
, O
stop O
, O
you O
got O
to O
complete O
what O
you O
're O
doing O
, O
you O
know O
. O

So O
I O
A O
Right O
. O

Allan O
Yeah O
, O
um O
. O

A O
But O
, O
they- O
they O
definitely O
need O
to O
take O
a O
back O
seat O
to O
some O
sort O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
some O
sort O
of O
Iraqi B-LOC
government O
there O
. O

I O
know O
they O
set O
up O
the O
council O
, O
uh O
, O
interim O
council O
, O
but O
that O
has O
n't O
gone O
, O
you O
know O
, O
perfe- O
smoothly O
. O

Um O
, O
they O
still O
-- O
Americans O
have O
been O
calling O
the O
shots O
. O

So O
, O
if O
they O
can O
just O
sort O
of O
make O
a O
-- O
be- O
get O
into O
more O
of O
a O
supportive O
role O
and O
, O
you O
know O
, O
flex O
their O
muscles O
when O
they O
need O
to O
and O
maybe O
that O
will O
help- O
help O
, O
uh O
, O
squall O
some O
of O
the O
vi- O
the O
violence O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

Eh O
, O
if O
they O
could O
've O
-- O
if O
they O
could've O
shored O

that O

I O
do O
n't O

if O
that O
could O

uh O
, O
if O
that O

Putin O

noted O

other O
US B-LOC

With O
opposition O
hardening O
, O
the O
White B-LOC
House I-LOC
left O
open O
the O
possibility O
Tuesday O
that O
it O
would O
not O

its O

'' O
presidential O

Ari O

The O
comments O
came O
as O
President O
George O

his O
advisers O
looked O
beyond O
the O
diplomatic O
showdown O

made O
plans O

One O
option O
under O
serious O
consideration O
was O
Bush O
giving O
Iraqi B-LOC

a O

The O
officials O

on O

stressed O
that O
a O
variety O
of O
options O
are O
on O
the O
table O
and O
they O
all O
depend O
on O
the O
outcome O
of O
a O
U.N B-ORG

Security O

on O
the O
U.S.-backed B-LOC

The O
United B-LOC

still O
does O

have O
the O

win O

according O
to O
supporters O

opponents O
, O
and O
many O
undecided O

are O
looking O
for O
a O
compromise O
. O

Even O
if O
he O
gets O
the O
required O
votes O
, O
Bush O
needs O
to O
avoid O
a O
veto O
by O
Russia B-LOC
, O
France B-LOC
or O
China B-LOC
who O
all O
favor O
continuing O

at O

Once O
the O

resolved O
one O

another O
, O
Bush O

intensify O
his O

, O
barring O

as O
Saddam O

In O
addition O
to O
a O

, O
they O
have O
discussed O
a O

a O
Cabinet O

as O
ways O
for O
Bush O

communicate O
his O

next O

. O

As O
those O
discussions O
were O
taking O
place O
behind O
the O
scenes O
, O
Fleischer O
told O
reporters O
that O
Turkey B-LOC
would O
lose O
a O
proposed O
$ O
15 O
billion O
aid O
package O
unless O
it O
admits O
troops O
into O
the O
country O
for O
the O
Iraq B-LOC
conflict O
. O

`` O
The O
particular O
package O
that O
we O
've O
been O
talking O
to O

about O

predicated O
on O

in O
any O

'' O
Fleischer O
said O

Until O
Tuesday O
, O
the O

had O
suggested O
part O
of O
the O

would O
be O
available O
to O
Turkey B-LOC

of O

allowed O

White B-LOC
House I-LOC

said O
they O
were O
turning O
up O

hopes O
that O
the O

grant O
the O

request O
on O
a O

Even O
so O
, O

not O

just O
the O

the O
existence O
of O
the O
testing O
range O
is O
evidence O
that O
the O
country O
intends O
to O
manufacture O
much O
more O
sophisticated O
weapons O
that O
would O
be O
light O
enough O
to O
put O
onto O
its O
growing O
arsenal O
of O
medium- O
and O
long-range O
missiles O
. O

Previously O
, O
U.S B-LOC
. O

officials O
had O
said O
they O
were O
uncertain O
whether O
North B-LOC
Korea I-LOC
had O
received O
enough O
outside O
technical O
help O
to O
even O
attempt O
to O
make O
such O
a O
`` O
miniaturized O
'' O
nuclear O
warhead O
. O

The O
new O
testing O
capability O
would O
suggest O
that O
the O
North O
Koreans O
are O
getting O
closer O
_ O
now O
, O
officials O
said O
, O
the O
intelligence O
reports O
say O
they O
could O
do O
in O
in O
as O
little O
as O
a O
year O
or O
less O
. O

But O
officials O
say O
there O
is O
no O
sure O
way O
of O
knowing O
that O
they O
can O
until O
they O
actually O
test O
one O
. O

Senior O
administration O
officials O
say O
that O
Washington B-LOC
has O
been O
trying O
to O
convince O
Asiagent B-LOC
that O
it O
requires O
a O
unified O
diplomatic O
front O
to O
force O
the O
country O
to O
give O
up O
its O
weapons O
. O

The O
new O
intelligence O
is O
apparently O
being O
marshaled O
to O
support O
the O
administration O
's O
argument O
. O

According O
to O
officials O
who O
have O
been O
briefed O
on O
the O
U.S B-LOC
. O

reports O
, O
conventional O
explosions O
simulating O
a O
nuclear O
detonation O
have O
been O
set O
off O
at O
the O
testing O
site O
, O
which O
is O
near O
North B-LOC
Korea I-LOC
's O
main O
nuclear O
complex O
. O

North B-LOC
Korea I-LOC
has O
never O
tested O
a O
nuclear O
weapon O
, O
though O
the O
CIA B-ORG
long O
ago O
estimated O
that O
it O
manufactured O
two O
crude O
devices O
in O
the O
late O
1980s O
or O
early O
1990s O
. O

North B-LOC
Korea I-LOC
, O
unlike O
Iraq B-LOC
, O
has O
made O
no O
secret O
of O
its O
plan O
to O
develop O
nuclear O
weapons O
. O

Now O
, O
administration O
officials O
say O
they O
fear O
that O
the O
country O
is O
on O
the O
verge O
of O
producing O
five O
or O
six O
new O
weapons O
, O
some O
of O
which O
might O
be O
miniaturized O
. O

`` O
This O
would O
give O
them O
the O
range O
they O
never O
had O
before O
, O
and O
the O
chance O
to O
spread O
their O
threat O
far O
beyond O
South B-LOC
Korea I-LOC
, O
'' O
said O
one O
senior O
Asian B-LOC
official O
, O
noting O
that O
approximately O
60,000 O
U.S B-LOC
. O

troops O
are O
based O
in O
Japan B-LOC
. O

`` O
It O
changes O
the O
dynamics O
of O
the O
problem O
. O
'' O

The O
new O
intelligence O
estimates O
provided O
to O
Asian B-LOC
allies O
, O
however O
, O
left O
it O
unclear O
how O
quickly O
the O
North O
could O
produce O
the O
small O
warheads O
. O

The O
worst-case O
estimate O
, O
officials O
say O
, O
is O
that O
they O
could O
do O
so O
in O
less O
than O
a O
year O

satellites O
have O
been O
watching O
North B-LOC
Korean I-LOC
nuclear O
activity O
intently O
since O
late O
last O
year O
, O
when O
the O
North O
evicted O
international O
inspectors O
. O

Those O
inspectors O
had O
stood O
guard O
over O
a O
collection O
of O
8,000 O
spent O
nuclear O
fuel O
rods O
, O
which O
can O
be O
reprocessed O
into O
weapons-grade O
plutonium O
. O

In O
January O
the O
country O
began O
to O
re-start O
its O
nuclear O
rexrOgessing O
equipment O
, O
which O
had O
been O
mothballed O
for O
nearly O
a O
decade O
under O
a O
1994 O
agreement O
with O
the O
Clinton O
administration O
. O

But O
according O
to O
U.S B-LOC
. O

officials O
, O
it O
now O
appears O
that O
North B-LOC
Korean I-LOC
engineers O
ran O
into O
technical O
problems O
in O
restarting O
the O
facilities O
. O

While O
intelligence O
officials O
have O
reached O
no O
consensus O
, O
they O
told O
allies O
last O
week O
that O
in O
the O
worst O
case O
, O
only O
a O
few O
hundred O
of O
the O
8,000 O
rods O
had O
been O
converted O
into O
plutonium O
. O

It O
would O
take O
1,000 O
to O
1,500 O
rods O
to O
make O
enough O
plutonium O
for O
a O
weapon O
, O
experts O
say.O O
`` O
What O
we O
are O
told O
is O
that O
it O
would O
take O
perhaps O
six O
months O
after O
that O
to O
produce O
a O
miniaturized O
warhead O
, O
and O
put O
it O
into O
one O
of O
the O

, O
'' O
said O
one O
senior O
official O
who O
has O
recently O
reviewed O
the O

. O

`` O
But O
after O
Iraq B-LOC
, O
who O
knows O
how O
good O
those O
estimates O
are O
? O
'' O

After O
the O
claims O
made O
about O
prohibited O
weapons O
in O
Iraq B-LOC
, O
which O
have O
not O
been O
found O
so O
far O
, O
skepticism O
about O
the O
quality O
of O
U.S B-LOC
. O

intelligence O
is O
widespread O
. O

And O
in O
the O
case O
of O
North B-LOC
Korea I-LOC
, O
as O
in O
Iraq B-LOC
, O
the O
immediacy O
of O
the O
threat O
depends O
on O
whose O
analysis O
seems O
most O
compelling O
. O

So O
far O
, O
U.S B-LOC
. O

intelligence O
has O
picked O
up O
almost O
no O
sign O
of O
the O
telltale O
krypton O
gas O
that O
is O
released O
into O
the O
atmosphere O
when O
nuclear O
fuel O
rods O
are O
converted O
into O
weapons-grade O
plutonium O
. O

This O
has O
led O
some O
analysts O
to O
argue O
that O
the O
North O
Koreans O
may O
be O
farther O
from O
producing O
a O
weapon O
than O
feared O
a O
few O
months O
ago O
. O

But O
others O
note O
that O
trucks O
were O
seen O
carrying O
the O
rods O
out O
of O
their O
normal O
storage O
area O
months O
ago O
, O
and O
it O
is O
unclear O
where O
they O
are O
_ O
or O
even O
whether O
the O
United B-LOC

is O
sniffing O
for O
the O
krypton O
gas O
in O
the O
right O
place O
. O

`` O
We O
do O
n't O
believe O
that O

ordered O
to O
pay O
more O
than O
4 O

Before O

there O
had O
been O
speculations O
among O

on O
whether O
Waksal O

get O
leniency O

his O

But O
the O
order O
just O
released O
from O

has O
obviously O
separated O
Waksal O

from O
his O
legal O

. O

Amid O
the O

the O

cracking O
down O
on O

malfeasance O
, O
Waksal O
pleaded O
guilty O

October O

charges O
involving O
his O
efforts O
to O
sell O
a O
huge O
block O
of O
his O
company O
' O

stock O
in O
late O
2001 O

The O
attempt O

were O

before O

This O

Biography O
of O
Jo-Ann O
Bellucci O
My O
biography O
changed O
completely O
5 O
years O
ago O
when O
I O
contracted O
a O
very O
severe O
case O
of O
fibromyalga O
. O

Usually O
I O
say O
nothing O
about O
it O
although O
it O
has O
severly O
limited O
my O
life O
, O
no O
truthly O
changed O
it O
completely O
! O

This O
time O
I O
decided O
to O
just O
say O
it O
up O
front O
and O
go O
back O
and O
talk O
about O
the O
good O
old O
days O
, O
when O
life O
was O
a O
kick O

now O
live O

Teddy O
! O

I O
just O
turned O
50 O
years O
old O
this O
Christmas O
. O

When O
I O
had O
a O
j.o.b O
. O

I O
ran O
a O
software O
company O
for O
a O
few O
years O
and O
then O
started O

have O

them O
how O
to O

it O
freed O

allowed O

to O

great O

instead O

Those O
of O

very O

used O

be O

On O

one O
day O

unexpectedly O
, O
they O
dressed O
me O
up O
in O
safety O
equipment O
and O
ran O
me O
down O
the O
mine O
shaft O
. O

I O
mention O
this O
because O
I O
never O
really O
got O
over O
, O
after O
that O
, O
how O
much O
we O
take O
advantage O
of O
evryday O
things O
... O
like O
the O
salt O
on O
our O

or O
the O

salt O
that O
keeps O
the O

After O
I O
learned O

A O

The O
old O
wedding O
problem O
Two O
of O
my O
nephews O
were O
excluded O
from O
their O
brother O
's O
wedding O
this O
weekend O
because O
they O
are O
not O
LDS B-ORG
. O

Of O
interest O
, O
neither O
went O
to O
the O
reception O
either O
. O

Both O
were O
extremely O
hurt O
, O
particularly O
since O
they O
know O
their O
brother O
could O
have O
had O
a O
civil O
ceremony O
and O
then O
been O
married O
in O
the O
temple O
later O
. O

I O
was O
offended O
because O
one O
of O
those O
nephews O
and O
I O
are O
very O
close O
, O
and O
he O
was O
really O
upset O
. O

The O
groom O
said O
`` O
it O
was O
n't O
quite O
what O
I O
had O
expected O
. O
'' O

The O
bride O
is O
not O
quite O
able O
to O
speak O
in O
front O
of O
strangers O
, O
so O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
she O
thought O
. O

She O
did O
tell O
my O
niece O
that O
she O
thought O
her O
husband O
was O
a O
good O
catch O
-- O
RM O
attending O
BYU B-ORG
and O
all O
that O
. O

I O
got O
a O
sort O
of O
an O
icky O
feeling O
when O
I O
realized O
the O
only O
people O
who O
did O
attend O
the O
kid O
's O
wedding O
was O
his O
unmedicated O
bi-polar O
mother O
and O
his O
father O
, O
who O
suffers O
from O
Alzheimers O
. O

Re O

The O
old O
wedding O
problem O
That O
's O
sad O
, O
Lee O
. O

I O
really O
think O
it O
's O
time O
for O
the O
church O
to O
admit O
that O
a O
civil O
ceremony O
followed O
by O
a O
temple O
sealing O
reaches O
the O
same O
goal O
, O
often O
in O
a O
more O
loving O
way O
, O
than O
insisting O
that O
only O
the O
sealing O
is O
worth O
doing O
. O

A O
change O
of O
that O
sort O
would O
be O
very O
simple O
to O
implement O
, O
and O
most O
church O
members O
would O
like O
it O
better O
than O
allowing O
non-LDS B-ORG
family O
members O
into O
the O
temple O
, O
which O
would O
actually O
be O
my O
preference O
. O

There O
's O
been O
a O
thread O
recently O
in O
one O
of O
the O
exMo O
fora O
about O
a O
woman O
whose O
bishop O
, O
who O
she O
had O
been O
planning O
to O
have O
marry O
her O
, O
was O
going O
out O
of O
town O
, O
so O
she O
asked O
the O
stake O
president O
, O
who O
she O
did O
n't O
know O
well O
. O

He O
insisted O
that O
he O
needed O
to O
make O
the O
point O
, O
as O
part O
of O
performing O
the O
ceremony O
, O
that O
she O
really O
needed O
to O
be O
married O
in O
the O
temple O
, O
even O
though O
her O
fiance O
was O
not O
LDS B-ORG
. O

She O
ultimately O
declined O
his O
services O
. O

How O
to O
get O
the O
message O
across O
to O
young O
people O
that O
considering O
the O
feelings O
of O
their O
family O
is O
just O
as O
important O
as O
being O
sealed O
for O
time O
and O
all O
eternity O
? O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

It O
would O
have O
to O
be O
some O
sort O
of O
grassroots O
movement O
, O
I O
think O
, O
since O
it O
's O
not O
likely O
to O
come O
through O
official O
, O
correlated O
channels O
. O

Re O
: O
The O
old O
wedding O
problem O
*shrugs* O
I O
chose O
to O
have O
a O
civil O
ceremony O
largely O
because O
my O
wife O
and O
I O
were O
both O
converts O
and O
a O
temple O
ceremony O
would O
have O
excluded O
both O
families O
completely O
. O

From O
a O
family O
standpoint O
it O
sounded O
liek O
a O
good O
decision O
, O
harmony O
and O
all O
that O
... O
plus O
the O
temple O
ceremony O
could O
be O
sealed O
a O
year O
later O
. O

Unfortunately O
we O
started O
off O
on O
the O
wrong O
foot O
for O
a O
lot O
of O
reasons O
and O
the O
marriage O
did O
n't O
last O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
help O
but O
wonder O
if O
perhaps O
we O
did O
ourselves O
a O
diservice O
by O
not O
getting O
sealedi O
ntially O
, O
and O
making O
our O
marriage O
a O
gospel O
focused O
one O
. O

Who O
's O
to O
say O
. O

It O
's O
a O
tough O
decision O
to O
make O
and O
despite O
the O
feeling O
I O
myself O
caved O
I O
feel O
people O
should O
be O
understanding O
of O
the O
rationale O
. O

For O
my O
part O
if O
we O
had O
been O
sealed O
intially O
there O
simply O
would O
n't O
have O
been O
ANYONE O
there O
and O
both O
our O
families O
had O
harsh O
feeligns O
about O
the O
church O
as O
is O
, O
and O
a O
sealign O
would O
have O
only O
created O
more O
disharmony O
. O

For O
my O
part O
though O
, O
I O
think O
we O
started O
the O
marriage O
with O
a O
compromise O
and O
deined O
ourselves O
tremendous O
blessing O
and O
ultimately O
paid O
the O
price O
. O

divorce O
is O
really O
stupid O
... O

I O
think O
divorce O
is O
really O
stupid O
. O

It O
'll O
take O
me O
awhile O
to O
get O
to O
thought O
stream O
that O
got O
me O
to O
that O
thought O
today O
. O

First O
off O
, O
I O
'm O
remarried O
, O
divorced O
3 O
years O
ago O
. O

I O
love O
my O
wife O
, O
and O
the O
kids O
get O
along O
just O
fine O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
like O
my O
exwife O
. O

But O
there O
was O
a O
time O
when O
I O
did O
like O
her O
; O
in O
fact O
I O
loved O
her O
very O
much O
in O
spite O
of O
her O
numerous O
flaws O
, O
chief O
among O
those O
flaws O
is O
that O
she O
's O
a O
narcicists O
. O

But O
we O
all O
have O
some O
sort O
of O
personality O
problems O
... O
. O
My O
wife O
belongs O
to O
a O
support O
group O
, O
and O
just O
for O
fun O
, O
they O
all O
googled O
their O
hubbies O
ex O
's O
. O

Somehow O
, O
this O
lead O
me O
to O
googling O
my O
ex O
's O
boyfriend O
, O
call O
him O
B O
. O

And O
there O
he O
was O
, O
talking O
about O
plans O
with O
his O
wife O
and O
kids O
. O

Wow O
. O

To O
me O
, O
B O
was O
just O
this O
one O
dimensional O
guy O
that O
was O
being O
dragged O
along O
by O
my O
exwife O
. O

Now O
, O
he O
turns O
out O
to O
have O
a O
3 O
dimensional O
life O
too O
. O

I O
guess O
we O
all O
do O
. O

I O
'd O
like O
to O
take O
him O
out O
for O
a O
beer O
sometime O
. O

It O
would O
be O
fun O
. O

I O
wonder O
what O
happenned O
to O
B O
's O
son O
? O

My O
kids O
never O
mentioned O
B O
having O
a O
son O
. O

B O
's O
son O
is O
apparently O
16 O
years O
old O
, O
same O
age O
as O
my O
daughter O
. O

I O
wonder O
if O
B O
had O
a O
huge O
messy O
divorce O
, O
and O
his O
ex O
took O
the O
kid O
out O
of O
state O
. O

My O
ex O
threatened O
that O
. O

Ouch O
. O

Divorce O
really O
sucks O
. O

I O
have O
my O
kids O
almost O
50/50 O
these O
days O
, O
but O
it O
was O
a O
huge O
messy O
post O
divorce O
compromise O
that O
took O
a O
year O
to O
complete O
. O

I O
wonder O
if O
B O
had O
to O
go O
through O
some O
of O
the O
same O
kind O
of O
shit O
? O

Perhaps O
my O
exwife O
has O
more O
sympathy O
for O
what O
its O
like O
to O
be O
a O
guy O
on O
the O
receiving O
end O
of O
a O
divorce O
now O
? O

Ok O
, O
keep O
googling O
. O

Oh O
my O
, O
the O
plot O
thickens O
. O

I O
found O
B O
's O
exwife O
. O

Very O
articulate O
writer O
. O

This O
is O
really O
humorous O
. O

She O
wrote O
an O
article O
about O
a O
divorce O
support O
group O
, O
ending O
it O
with O
something O
about O
Mrs. O
B O
being O
happily O
married O
but O
she O
's O
impressed O
by O
the O
divorce O
support O
group O
. O

And O
that O
was O
only O
4 O
years O
ago O
! O

Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
B O
had O
a O
real O
life O
too O
. O

They O
shared O
dreams O
together O
, O
raised O
a O
kid O
, O
and O
probably O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
fun O
together O
. O

Now O
I O
'm O
even O
more O
curious O
about O
the O
B O
's O
kid O
. O

She O
still O
lives O
in O
town O
here O
. O

Maybe O
there O
was O
some O
sort O
of O
terrible O
tragedy O
? O
? O
? O

I O
'll O
have O
to O
ask O
about O
B O
's O
kid O
when O
my O
own O
kids O
switch O
off O
next O
week O
. O

Sometimes O
we O
want O
to O
see O
marriage O
one O
dimensionally O
. O

Either O
its O
bad O
or O
good O
. O

That O
's O
total O
bullshit O
. O

I O
know O
my O
first O
marriage O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
good O
adventures O
, O
a O
lot O
of O
friendship O
, O
a O
lot O
of O
love O
. O

Oh O
, O
yeah O
, O
it O
was O
n't O
perfect O
. O

My O
exwife O
is O
a O
total O
pain O
in O
the O
ass O
much O
of O
the O
time O
, O
and O
I O
tried O
to O
let O
her O
do O
what O
she O
wanted O
, O
sometimes O
I O
could O
n't O
. O

But O
, O
even O
to O
the O
end O
, O
we O
loved O
each O
other O
. O

And O
now O
, O
I O
see O
the O
lost O
family O
ties O
. O

She O
's O
lost O
my O
family O
, O
I O
'm O
slowly O
drifting O
out O
of O
touch O
with O
her O
family O
. O

We O
both O
build O
new O
lives O
. O

New O
lives O
. O

But O
you O
know O
, O
as O
long O
as O
the O
kids O
are O
shared O
, O
you O
can't O
total O
get O
this O
exspouse O
out O
of O
your O
mental O
psyche O
. O

They O
say O
it O
takes O
one O
year O
for O
every O
two O
that O
you O
were O
married O
. O

I O
believe O
that O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
life O
goes O
on O
. O

My O
wife O
's O
name O
is O
M. O
We O
're O
going O
to O
a O
bed O
and O
breakfast O
this O
weekend O
, O
to O
get O
away O
, O
relax O
. O

M O
and O
I O
are O
slowly O
building O
a O
history O
of O
our O
own O
together O
. O

We O
share O
adventures O
together O
, O
we O
share O
adventure O
with O
my O
kids O
, O
and O
with O
our O
dogs O
. O

And O
, O
I O
take O
lots O
of O
pictures O
. O

I O
really O
have O
n't O
changed O
very O
much O
from O
who O
I O
was O
before O
. O

Although O
, O
the O
dog O
thing O
is O
really O
post O
divorce O
. O

Lots O
and O
lots O
of O
pictures O
. O

Sometimes O
I O
look O
at O
the O
old O
photos O
, O
before O
divorce O
. O

We O
smiled O
together O
, O
laughed O
, O
hugged O
. O

I O
was O
one O
of O
the O
first O
digital O
camera O
users O
, O
and O
I O
have O
too O
many O
photos O
from O
my O
first O
marriage O
. O

Sometimes O
I O
feel O
like O
I O
'm O
racing O
to O
create O
enough O
photos O
of O
my O
new O
life O
to O
outweigh O
the O
long O
history O
of O
my O
first O
life O
. O

That O
's O
going O
to O
take O
awhile O
... O
Luckily O
, O
we O
flawed O
human O
beings O
live O
long O
lives O
, O
and O
digital O
cameras O
take O
lots O
and O
lots O
of O
pictures O
! O

If O
my O
exwife O
does O
n't O
dump O
B O
, O
maybe O
they O
'll O
wind O
up O
staying O
together O
, O
maybe O
even O
getting O
married O
. O

I O
think O
that O
would O
be O
nice O
. O

And O
they O
too O
will O
begin O
the O
process O
of O
rebuilding O
their O
`` O
together O
'' O
lives O
. O

I'm O
assuming O
there O
is O
some O
humanity O
beneath O
my O
exwife O
's O
narcicistic O
shell O
, O
but O
I O
do O
believe O
there O
is O
. O

B O
seems O
like O
a O
decent O
enough O
person O
too O
. O

So O
, O
B O
and O
my O
ex O
will O
be O
doing O
the O
same O
thing O
that O

Re O
: O

is O

... O

Your O
post O
made O
me O
horribly O
sad O
. O

My O
ex O
has O
that O
nice O
new O
life O
with O
the O
child-bride O
and O
the O
2 O
cats O
and O
2 O
dogs O
and O
new O
house O
and O
my O
son O
primarily O
lives O
with O
them O
even O
though O
he O
ends O
up O
being O
at O
my O
place O
1/2 O
the O
time O
in O
a O
2-week O
period O
. O

-- O
I O
live O
in O
a O
961 O
sq O
. O

ft. O
apartment O
. O

My O
ex O
has O
most O
all O
of O
the O
photos O
as O
our O
son O
lives O
there O
and O
it O
's O
his O
history O
. O

I O
did O
get O
a O
good O
bunch O
of O
the O
wedding O
photos O
, O
but O
my O
ex O
refused O
to O
give O
them O
all O
to O
me O
saying O
it O
was O
`` O
his O
life O
too O
'' O
even O
though O
I O
really O
resent O
them O
being O
under O
the O
same O
roof O
with O
his O
child-bride O
. O

I O
'm O
sure O
they O
are O
taking O
lots O
of O
pictures O
of O
their O
trips/vacations/whatever O
( O
at O
least O
2 O
that O
I O
know O
of O
) O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
own O
a O
camera O
. O

His O
new O
inlaws O
are O
all O
former O
family O
friends O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
anything O
to O
do O
with O
anymore O
for O
obvious O
reasons O
. O

His O
family O
( O
brother O
, O
sister O
, O
stepmother O
) O
conveniently O
seem O
to O
forget O
that O
for O
almost O
20 O
years O
I O
was O
a O
member O
of O
their O
family O
. O

There O
was O
no O
gradual O
`` O
drifting O
of O
out O
touch O
'' O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
all O
live O
in O
the O
same O
city O
and O
my O
ex O
BIL O
and O
I O
even O
work O
within O
blocks O
of O
each O
other O
. O

My O
family O
thinks O
my O
ex O
is O
pond O
scum O
but O
because O
my O
parents O
are O
still O
members O
at O
the O
same O
church O
, O
they O
have O
to O
see O
my O
ex O
and O
his O
new O
wife O
every O
week O
. O

My O
mother O
took O
his O
remarriage O
harder O
than O
I O
did O
, O
I O
think O
, O
because O
of O
that O
. O

Divorce O
*is* O
really O
stupid O
. O

Duh-uh O
. O

Especially O
for O
those O
of O
us O
who O
still O
have O
so O
many O
years O
( O
if O
one O
year O
for O
every O
2 O
married O
, O
then O
I've O
still O
got O
another O
7 O
or O
so O
) O
to O
go O
to O
get O
our O
heads O
screwed O
back O
on O
and O
find O
some O
sort O
of O
life O
that O
rivals O
what O
we O
had O
or O
what O
our O
ex O
has O
or O
what O
you O
and O
your O
ex O
have O
. O

So O
far O

this O
is O
not O

Then O
there O
was O
the O
class O
action O
suit O
against O
Gateway B-ORG
brought O
by O
some O
Philadelphia B-LOC
lawyers O
a O
number O
of O
years O
ago O
. O

Gateway B-ORG
advertised O
and O
stickered O
many O
of O
its O
486 O
computers O
as O
`` O
Pentium O
Ready O
'' O
, O
meaning O
that O
a O
special O
Type O
3 O
ZIF O
socket O
Pentium O
OverDrive O
could O
be O
installed O
and O
run O
. O

Micronics B-ORG
designed O
the O
motherboards O
used O
by O
Gateway B-ORG
, O
and O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
design O
was O
a O
prototype O
Pentium O
OverDrive O
with O
an O
internal O
write-through O
cache O
, O
a O
more O
conservative O
cache O
design O
. O

Then O
Intel B-ORG
changed O
the O
Pentium O
OverDrive O
, O
and O
the O
final O
version O
had O
a O
write-BACK O
cache O
. O

When O
installed O
in O
a O
Gateway B-ORG
system O
, O
the O
chip O
ran O
slower O
than O
slow O
, O
maybe O
about O
as O
fast O
as O
an O
IBM B-ORG
AT O
, O
and O
bus-mastering O
devices O
like O
NICs O
and O
SCSI O
cards O
refused O
to O
work O
. O

So O
the O
lawyers O
sued O
Gateway B-ORG
, O
and O
the O
settlement O
approved O
by O
the O
judge O
consisted O
of O
megabucks O
for O
the O
lawyers O
and O
coupons O
to O
owners O
of O
Gateway B-ORG
486 O
computers O
. O

The O
coupon O
was O
good O
for O
$ O
50 O
off O
on O
the O
purchase O
of O
a O
Pentium O
OverDrive O
processor O
from O
Gateway B-ORG
, O
at O
its O
usual O
inflated O
prices O
! O
! O
! O

So O
, O
let O
's O
see O
. O

What O
does O
a O
discount O
coupon O
for O
a O
processor O
I O
can't O
use O
in O
my O
system O
do O
for O
me O
? O

I O
wonder O
how O
many O
people O
gleefully O
cashed O
in O
their O
coupons O
and O
bought O
Pentium O
OverDrives O
from O
Gateway B-ORG
. O

Intel B-ORG
eventually O
compensated O
by O
making O
available O
an O
`` O
interposer O
'' O
, O
a O
little O
socketed O
thingie O
installed O
between O
the O
Pentium O
OverDrive O
and O
the O
ZIF O
socket O
. O

The O
sole O
purpose O
of O
the O
interposer O
was O
to O
raise O
a O
signal O
on O
the O
CPU O
to O
force O
its O
cache O
to O
operate O
in O
the O
write-thru O
mode O
which O
was O
compatible O
with O
most O
ZIF O
Socket O
3 O
486 O
motherboards O
. O

Needless O
to O
say O
, O
this O
was O
the O
least O
successful O
`` O
OverDrive O
'' O
CPU O
ever O
done O
by O
Intel B-ORG
. O

The O
486-DX4 O
OverDrive O
was O
OK O
, O
as O
were O
several O
Socket O
5 O
Pentium O
OverDrives O
and O
the O
Socket O
8 O
Pentium O
Pro O
OverDrive O
. O

Finally O
Intel B-ORG
gave O
up O
on O
OverDrives O

at O
an O

rate O

I O
've O
read O
that O
too O

unfortunate O
, O

I O
've O
worked O
with O
them O
in O
Rwanda B-LOC

was O
very O
impressed O
with O
the O
professionalism O
of O
their O

They O
also O
stated O
that O
there O
are O
lots O

places O
in O
the O
world O
where O
they O
continue O
to O
work O
which O
needs O
plenty O

too O
- O
quite O
an O
important O
reminder O
because O
other O
needy O
areas O
of O
the O
world O
are O
getting O
less O
donations O
now O
. O

So O
they O
did O
n't O
discourage O
donations O
to O
them O
per O
se O
, O
just O
not O
for O
this O
specific O
area O
. O

Of O
course O
I O
realize O
that O
most O
people O
will O
want O
to O
help O
where O
the O
need O
for O
it O
is O
the O
most O
immediate O

In O
Q B-LOC
he O

in O

of O
the O
car O
from O
the O
moment O
he O
attempts O
to O
put O
the O
key O
in O
the O

. O

If O
he O
's O

with O
the O
keys O
in O
his O
possession O
then O
he O
's O
the O
person O
in O
charge O
of O
the O
car O
. O

The O
offence O
is O
being O
drunk O
in O
charge O
of O
a O
vehicle O
-- O
as O
distinct O
from O
being O
drunk O
while O
operating O
a O
vehicle O
( O
which O
is O
a O
separate O
offence O
) O
. O

The O
way O
to O
avoid O
being O
charged O
is O
to O
give O
the O
keys O
to O
someone O
else O
to O
unlock O
the O
door O
and O
have O
them O
hang O
on O
to O
the O
keys O
until O
you O
're O
below O
.05 O
. O

The O
standard O
ruse O
is O
to O
throw O
the O
keys O
under O
the O
car O
after O
you O
've O
unlocked O
the O
door O
( O
which O
you O
can O
later O
claim O
was O
unlocked O
by O
a O
person O
unknown O
) O
. O

In O
this O
case O
the O
offender O
escaped O
conviction O
first O
time O
around O
because O
it O
was O
accepted O
that O
he O
attempted O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
the O
keys O
, O
which O
supposedly O
landed O
in O
his O
lap O

just O

If O

as O
you O

the O

the O

his O

The O

that O

Agreed O

not O

If O
you O

have O
an O

water O

available O
, O
have O
you O
considered O
just O
staying O

? O

I O
understand O
hypnobirthing O
can O
be O
very O
helpful O

I O
am O
not O
pursuing O
it O
because O
I O
was O
able O
to O
go O
inside O
the O
pain O
to O
the O
good O
place O
without O
training O
, O
last O
time O
. O

I O
have O
not O
been O
thinking O
much O
about O
the O
hard O
part O
of O
labor O
prior O
to O
getting O
so O
close O

Now O
I O

I O

If O
you O
go O
for O
a O

you O
can O
rent O
a O
birthing O
pool O
. O

I O
would O
n't O
necessaritly O
say O
that O
you O
will O
have O
a O
repeat O
labour O
! O

My O
first O
labour O
I O
was O
30 O
hours O
and O
had O
an O
epidural O
after O
22 O
hours O
. O

# O

I O
went O
in O
saying O
`` O
give O
me O
the O
epidural O
asap-and O
never O
got O
to O
the O
state O
where O
I O
felt O
that O
I O
needed O
it O
. O

Only O
had O
tens O
and O
gas-and-air O

So O
do O
n't O
give O
up O
on O
the O
idea O
of O
a O
natural O
birth O
because O
last O
time O
was O
painful O

I O
think O
different O
people/different O
labours O
are O
different O

so O
just O
because O
one O
person O
says O
`` O
I O
did O

it O
did O
n't O
hurt O
a O

does O
n't O
mean O
that O
it O
will O
work O

going O

that O

simply O

that O
if O

in O
demanding O
that O

All O
the O
FL B-LOC
prosecutors O
have O
to O
do O
is O
ask O
, O
and O
the O
AZ B-LOC
jailers O
will O
pack O

ship O
her O

and O
probably O
to O
commence O
her O
serving O
time O
under O
the O
suspended O
sentence O
that O
went O
along O
with O
her O
original O
probation O

She O
's O
in O
DEEP O
SH__T O
if O
you O
have O
n't O
already O
figure O
that O
out O
. O

Nowhere O
in O
USA B-LOC
would O
be O
far O
enough O
if O
she O
waived O
extradition O
. O

Of O
course O
they O
do O
. O

That O
's O
what O
her O
waiver O
of O
extradition O
meant O
they O
could O
do O
. O

They O
let O
her O
serve O
her O
time O
in O
AZ B-LOC
, O
then O
they O
come O
and O
get O
her O
to O
serve O
her O
time O
in O
FL B-LOC
. O

This O
is O
what O
happens O
when O
people O
blow O
off O
the O
chances O
they O
are O
given O
to O
straighten O
out O
by O
being O
given O
probation O
. O

Thumb O
your O
nose O
at O
the O
court O
often O
enough O
, O
and O
they O
will O
bring O
all O
sorts O
of O
crap O
down O
on O
your O
head O
, O
re-instituting O
the O
original O
suspended O
sentences O
and O
possibly O
adding O
on O
for O
the O
FTA O
. O

What O
is O
it O
GOOD O
for O
? O

It O
's O
good O
for O
the O
STATE O
, O
not O
for O
the O
convict O
. O

It O
lets O
them O
skip O
some O
of O
the O
legal O
procedures O
she O
would O
otherwise O
be O
entitled O
to O
, O
in O
order O
to O
ship O
her O
from O
one O
state O
to O
another O
. O

But O
they O
were O
entitled O
to O
demand O
that O
waiver O
as O
a O
condition O
of O
probation O
; O
if O
she O
had O
not O
agreed O
to O
voluntarily O
waive O
that O
right O
, O
they O
probably O
would O
have O
just O
thrown O
her O
in O
jail O
for O
the O
3 O
year O
sentence O
the O
first O
time O
around O
and O
she O
would O
n't O
have O
been O
given O
the O
chance O
to O
go O
straight O
during O
probation O
and O
avoid O
jail O
altogether O
. O

She O
does O
n't O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
leeway O
here O
. O

She O
has O
done O
this O
numerous O
times O
and O
they O
are O
not O
likely O
to O
give O
her O
another O
wide O
open O
chance O
like O
they O
did O
the O
first O
3 O
times O
. O

She O
will O
probably O
have O
to O
serve O
out O
her O
sentence O
in O
FL B-LOC
, O
AND O
if O
she O
has O
not O
already O
served O
all O
her O
time O
in O
AZ B-LOC
, O
they O
will O
then O
ship O
her O
back O
there O
to O
do O
THAT O
time O
. O

Waitaminit O
, O
you O
said O
she O
DOES O
have O
a O
public O
defender O
? O

OK O
, O
he/she O
is O
doing O
all O
they O
can O
, O
but O
that O
's O
not O
much O
, O
under O
the O
circumstances O
. O

You O
're O
complaining O
that O
YOU O
ca O
n't O
get O
an O
atty O
? O

You O
do O
n't O
need O
one O
. O

And O
her O
attys O
will O
not O
talk O
to O
you O
because O
you O
are O
not O
entitled O
to O
participate O
in O
their O
confidential O
communications O
with O
their O
client O
. O

But O
wo O
n't O
your O
GF O
tell O
you O
these O
things O
? O

If O
not O
, O
maybe O
it O
's O
because O
she O
does O
n't O
want O
you O
to O
know O
either O
. O

Which O
you O
would O
then O
take O
into O
account O
in O
deciding O
if O
you O
still O
want O
her O
to O
be O

Question O
regarding O
simple O
assault O
& O
amp O
; O
battery O
My O
roommate O
was O
hospitalized O
in O
mid-November O
for O
lung O
surgery O
and O
spent O
several O
days O
on O
loads O
of O
pain O
medication O
. O

On O
the O
fourth O
day O
of O
his O
stay O
, O
he O
was O
moved O
out O
of O
the O
ICU O
to O
the O
step-down O
unit O
, O
with O
a O
diagnosis O
of O
`` O
ICU O
Psychosis O
secondary O
to O
narcotic O
administration O
'' O
and O
post O
thoracostomy O
. O
'' O

He O
was O
confused O
, O
because O
of O
the O
medication O
but O
was O
not O
aggressive O
or O
threatening O
in O
any O
manner O
. O

I O
saw O
him O
each O
day O
and O
as O
soon O
as O
we O
spoke O
, O
he O
became O
oriented O
and O
was O
perfectly O
fine O
. O

This O
was O
witnessed O
by O
both O
the O
nursing O
staff O
and O
his O
doctors O
. O

During O
the O
early O
evening O
hours O
of O
his O
sixth O
hospital O
day O
, O
he O
got O
up O
, O
dressed O
, O
pulled O
his O
chest O
tube O
out O
and O
managed O
to O
get O
out O
of O
the O
hospital O
and O
across O
four O
lanes O
of O
busy O
evening O
traffic O
, O
to O
our O
apartment O
. O

By O
the O
time O
he O
got O
to O
our O
home O
, O
he O
was O
very O
short O
of O
breath O
and O
there O
was O
a O
nurse O
and O
orderly O
who O
told O
me O
`` O
he O
's O
crazy O
and O
just O
walked O
out O
. O
'' O

I O
sat O
him O
down O
on O
the O
couch O
and O
talked O
to O
him O
, O
and O
asked O
him O
what O
had O
happened O
. O

He O
said O
he O
'd O
asked O
for O
something O
for O
pain O
and O
they O
told O
hime O
he O
could O
n't O
have O
anything O
. O

Then O
the O
orderly O
was O
apparently O
rude O
to O
him O
, O
and O
that O
's O
when O
he O
got O
up O
and O
decided O
to O
come O
home O
. O

A O
short O
time O
later O
, O
two O
police O
officers O
showed O
up O
and O
told O
me O
they O
had O
to O
take O
him O
back O
to O
the O
hospital O
. O

He O
went O
back O
with O
the O
officers O
, O
gave O
them O
no O
problems O
at O
all O
. O

I O
received O
a O
call O
from O
the O
shift O
supervisor O
who O
told O
me O
they O
'd O
replaced O
his O
chest O
tube O
, O
given O
him O
some O
pain O
medication O
and O
he O
was O
doing O
much O
better O
. O

I O
told O
her O
to O
pass O
on O
the O
other O
shifts O
that O
if O
he O
became O
confused O
or O
upset O
to O
call O
me O
, O
and O
I O
'd O
talk O
to O
him O
, O
and O
get O
him O
settled O
down O
. O

At O
2:15 O
the O
next O
morning O
, O
I O
received O
a O
call O
from O
the O
night O
shift O
supervisor O
who O
told O
me O
my O
friend O
had O
been O
`` O
verbally O
abusive O
and O
aggressive O
'' O
and O
would O
I O
come O
over O
and O
talk O
to O
him O
. O

So O
, O
I O
went O
over O
there O
, O
getting O
to O
his O
room O
right O
at O
2:30 O
. O

There O
were O
two O
cops O
there O
and O
I O
asked O
what O
had O
happened O
. O

My O
roommate O
was O
in O
bed O
, O
sound O
asleep O
, O
and O
had O
all O
of O
his O
clothes O
on O
. O

A O
nurse O
said O
, O
`` O
He O
beat O
two O
of O
us O
up O
. O

The O
cops O
are O
here O
because O
we O
're O
pressing O
charges O
. O
'' O

I O
've O
lived O
with O
this O
man O
9 O
years O
and O
never O
in O
that O
time O
have O
I O
ever O
seen O
him O
be O
aggressive O
, O
violent O
or O
abusive O
in O
anyway O
. O

I O
asked O
to O
speak O
to O
the O
two O
nurses O
whom O
he O
'd O
alledgedly O
hit O
and O
was O
told O
I O
could O
n't O
do O
that O
. O

An O
hour O
or O
so O
passed O
and O
the O
got O
my O
roommate O
out O
of O
bed O
, O
took O
his O
chest O
tube O
out O
and O
discharged O
him O
. O

He O
was O
sent O
to O
another O
hospital O
with O
a O
psych O
unit O
until O
his O
psychosis O
resolved O
. O

I O
was O
given O
copies O
of O
a O
citation O
for O
simple O
assault O
and O
battery O
, O
then O
went O
to O
the O
police O
station O
several O
days O
later O
to O
find O
out O
what O
other O
paperwork O
was O
available O
on O
this O
incident O
. O

I O
was O
given O
a O
copy O
of O
a O
different O
citation O
, O
but O
with O
the O
identical O
information O
from O
the O
one O
I'd O
gotten O
the O
night O
of O
the O
incident O
. O

The O
police O
report O
has O
the O
victim O
saying O
she O
was O
`` O
choked O
to O
where O
she O
almost O
lost O
consciousness O
, O
struck O
in O
the O
face O
with O
a O
belt O
buckle O
and O
it O
had O
left O
large O
marks O
, O
and O
that O
he O
'd O
grabbed O
her O
breasts O
and O
left O
marks O
. O

According O
to O
the O
police O
report O
, O
this O
woman O
never O
reported O
to O
the O
ER O
for O
verification O
of O
the O
injuries O
and O
no O
one O
else O
can O
verify O
exactly O
what O
happened O
to O
provoke O
this O
incident O
. O

My O
roommate O
has O
no O
recollection O
of O
the O
time O
from O
the O
day O
before O
the O
incident O
happened O
until O
he O
woke O
up O
at O
the O
other O
hospital O
. O

He O
was O
cited O
for O
simple O
assault O
and O
battery O
. O

If O
there O
is O
no O
evidence O
, O
and O
that O
includes O
the O
belt O
buckle O
, O
how O
can O
the O
county O
prosecute O
this O
case O
. O
? O

All O
of O
his O
belongings O
were O
returned O
to O
me O
upon O
his O
discharge O
, O
with O
the O
exception O
of O
the O
belt O
buckle O
. O

The O
police O
do O
not O
have O
it O
and O
the O
hospital O
does O
n't O
know O
what O
happened O
to O
it O
. O

Also O
, O
I O
was O
looking O
at O
both O
citations O
, O
I O
did O
n't O
get O
to O
the O
hospital O
until O
2:30 O
am O
, O
and O
the O
officer O
has O
the O
time O
of O
incident O
as O
being O
at O
2:34 O
am O
. O

Does O
anyone O
besides O
me O
see O
a O
problem O
with O
any O
of O
this O
? O

What O
kind O
of O
recourse O
does O
my O
roommate O
have O
in O
all O
of O
this O
? O

Was O

Since O

the O

Yes O

you O

gave O

he O
had O
not O
yet O
received O

I O
believe O
you O
had O
said O
that O
you O
gave O
him O
the O
shares O
in O
February O
2004 O
but O
that O
the O
discharge O
did O
n't O
come O
until O
June O
of O
2004 O
. O

That O
means O
that O
he O
received O
the O
shares O
while O
he O
was O
still O
in O
bankruptcy O
, O
which O
means O
that O
the O
shares O
were O
potentially O
assets O
that O
the O
trustee O
could O
use O
to O
pay O
off O
creditors O
. O

A O
bankruptcy O
case O
does O
n't O
close O
until O
you O
get O
the O
discharge O
order O
, O
and O
until O
then O
everything O
that O
the O
debtor O
receives O
is O
fair O
game O
for O
the O
trustee O
. O

If O
the O
trustee O
was O
informed O
of O
the O
shares O
and O
did O
nothing O
about O
it O
, O
you O
are O
more O
likely O
than O
not O
ok O
, O
but O
if O
the O
trustee O
was O
n't O
informed O
of O
the O
fact O
directly O
, O
then O
you O
may O
be O
in O
trouble O
. O

If O
, O
however O
, O
your O
uncle O
received O
the O
shares O
after O
he O
obtained O
an O
order O
of O
discharge O
from O
the O
bankruptcy O
court O
, O
then O
as O
a O
general O
matter O
the O
creditors O
can O
not O
go O
after O
the O
shares O
, O
unless O
they O
can O
prove O
that O
there O
was O

You O
do O
well O
to O
wonder O
why O
the O
BTK O
killer O
was O
not O
captured O
until O
yesterday O
. O

The O
informal O
speculation O
is O
that O
the O
Wichita B-LOC
police O
department O
was O
not O
up O
to O
the O
task O
. O

Consider O
this O
: O
-One O
of O
the O
BTK O
killer O
's O
victims O
lived O
on O
the O
same O
street O
as O
the O
killer O
-The O
BTK O
killer O
once O
called O
up O
a O
police O
dispatcher O
and O
told O
her O
of O
the O
crime O
he O
just O
committed O
, O
and O
still O
they O
could O
not O
catch O
him O
-the O
BTK O
killer O
was O
a O
known O
nitpicker O
and O
nuissance O
. O

This O
is O
actually O
a O
indicator O
in O
profiles O
of O
serial O
killers O
and O
mastermind O
terrorists O
. O

-the O
BTK O
killer O
was O
only O
found O
out O
when O
his O
daughter O
recognized O
certain O
traits O
and O
turned O
in O
her O
DNA O
, O
which O
was O
a O
close O
match O
to O
the O
DNA O
on O
file O
for O
her O
father O
. O

Like O
in O
the O
case O
of O
the O
Unibomber O
, O
if O
it O
wasn't O
for O
the O
foresight O
and O
charity O
of O
a O
relative O
, O
the O
BTK O
killer O
would O
still O
be O
loose O
. O

I O
was O
once O
reading O
how O
a O
criminal O
was O
being O
tracked O
in O
Washington B-LOC
, O
DC B-LOC
, O
and O
how O
he O
escaped O
a O
police O
dragnet O
several O
times O
, O
once O
by O
taking O
a O
taxi O
. O

Though O
there O
are O
very O
brave O
police O
, O
to O
a O
large O
extent O
the O
police O
have O
no O
incentive O
to O
capture O
a O
criminal O
, O
just O
to O
stay O
out O
of O
harm O
's O
way O
and O
to O
collect O
facts O

the O
fact O
. O

With O
roughly O
three O
million O

cast O
in O
the O
race O
, O
the O
margin O
of O
victory O
was O
a O
few O
ten O
thousands O
of O
one O
percent O
or O
some O
such O
microscopic O
amount O
. O

For O
all O
intents O

purposes O
it O
was O
a O
tie- O
but O
somebody O
had O
to O
end O
up O
with O
a O

more O

and O
this O
time O

it O
was O

The O

`` O

there O

So O
the O

: O
Any O

halfway O
resembling O

just O
diddly O
dandy O

wo O

accept O

because O
there O
may O
have O
been O
a O
human O
error O
rate O
of O
0.0000001 O

. O

In O
Washington B-LOC

, O
the O
election O
has O
to O
be O
not O
only O
free O
and O
fair O
, O
but O
also O
`` O
perfect O
'' O
. O

( O
Of O

, O
the O
Republicans B-ORG
would O
have O
thought O
the O

*was* O
perfect O

some O

was O
elected O
USCF B-ORG
President O
on O
August O
11 O
, O
2003 O
in O
Los B-LOC

Immediately O
after O
she O
took O

she O
found O
out O
that O
the O
USCF B-ORG
had O
no O
money O
in O

The O
USCF B-ORG
did O

on O

bravely O
Beatriz O
walked O

the O
USCF B-ORG

fired O
17 O
staff O

John O

it O
was O
just O
a O
pure O
coincidence O
that O
the O

were O
the O

the O

that O
she O
worked O
for O
the O
USCF B-ORG

USCF B-ORG
paid O
the O
guaranteed O
prizes O
the O
prize O
winners O
had O
won O
at O

. O

I O
have O
just O
found O
out O
something O
that O
insiders O
had O
known O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

The O
USCF B-ORG
did O
not O
have O
zero O
money O
in O
the O
bank O
. O

It O
had O
$ O
85,000 O
in O
another O
bank O
account O
that O
nobody O
knew O
about O
. O

This O
was O
not O
due O
to O
any O
malfeasance O
. O

The O
office O
accountant O
for O
the O
USCF B-ORG
had O
set O
up O
a O
separate O
bank O
account O
and O
had O
put O
the O
entry O
fees O
from O
the O
US B-LOC
Open O
into O
that O
account O
. O

Nobody O
knew O
about O
that O
separate O
bank O
account O
, O
except O
for O
the O
accountant O
herself O
. O

When O
this O
was O
discovered O
, O
the O
accountant O
explained O
that O
she O
was O
planning O
to O
keep O
the O
money O
in O
that O
account O
until O
the O
tournament O
was O
closed O
out O
. O

Perhaps O
the O
accountant O
was O
following O
a O
procedure O
followed O
by O
the O
USCF B-ORG
for O
scholastic O
tournaments O
. O

At O
scholastic O
tournaments O
, O
no O
cash O
prizes O
are O
paid O
. O

However O
, O
in O
adult O
tournaments O
, O
the O
players O
expect O
to O
receive O
their O
prizes O
, O
and O
to O
receive O
them O
immediately O
. O

For O
this O
act O
of O
stupidity O
which O
had O
caused O
a O
grave O
crisis O
in O
the O
USCF B-ORG
, O
the O
accountant O
was O
immediately O
fired O
. O

Had O
the O
existence O
of O
this O
$ O
85,000 O
in O
a O
secret O
bank O
account O
been O
known O
, O
it O
would O
not O
have O
been O
necessary O
to O
fire O
those O
17 O
people O
right O
away O
. O

Perhaps O
in O
the O
long O
run O
it O
was O
a O
good O
thing O
to O

it O
might O

I O
really O
could O

believe O
what O
I O
was O
watching O
while O
Bush O
put O
medals O
on O
Talent O
, O
Franks O
and O
Bremer O
. O

Talent O
was O
in O
charge O
of O
the O
CIA B-ORG
when O
two O
of O
the O
most O
costly O
intelligence O
failures O
in O
American B-LOC
history O
happened O
-- O
not O
recognizing O
the O
Sept. O
11 O
plot O
, O
and O
wrongly O
claiming O
that O
Saddam O
had O
a O
stockpile O
of O
WMDs O
. O

Even O
people O
who O
mindlessly O
defend O
Bush's O
policies O
, O
like O
wjb67 O
, O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
take O
responsibility O
for O
Talent O
-- O
they O
point O
out O
that O
he O
was O
originally O
appointed O
by O
Clinton O

Franks O
was O
in O
charge O
of O
the O
operation O
that O
was O
supposed O
to O
quickly O
go O
in O
, O
take O
over O
Iraq B-LOC
, O
and O
then O
start O
moving O
our O
troops O
out O
rapidly O
-- O
at O
this O
point O
I O
think O
we O
're O
going O
to O
see O
our O
troops O
over O
there O
at O
least O
through O
the O
end O
of O
the O
decade O
. O

And O
Bremer O
decided O
to O
destroy O
the O
existing O
Iraqi B-LOC
army O
, O
leaving O
it O
up O
to O
us O
and O
new O
recruits O
to O
try O
to O
impose O
order O
. O

This O
is O
just O
one O
more O
of O
those O
wierd O
, O
through-the-looking-glass O
moments O
when O
Bush O
is O
trying O
to O
make O
something O
that O
at O
the O
very O
least O
has O
to O
be O
seen O
as O
troubling O

that O

maybe O
because O

of O
you O
may O

why O
there O
were O
two O

organizations O
in O
the O

The O
National B-ORG

1970 O

by O
a O
group O

art O
historians O

, O

Frederick O

, O
author O
of O
the O
1964 O
book O
`` O
A O
Pictorial O
History O
of O
The O
Carousel O
'' O
that O
single-handedly O
gave O
the O
classic O
hand-carved O
wooden O
carousel O
the O
respect O
and O
appreciation O
it O
deserved O
. O

Other O
founders O
included O
Charlotte O
Dinger O
, O
who O
was O
already O
a O
major O
collector O
of O
carousel O
artwork O
at O
the O
time O
. O

The O
purpose O
of O
the O
NCA B-ORG
is O
`` O
to O
promote O
conservation O
, O
appreciation O
, O
knowledge O
and O
enjoyment O

the O

and O
especially O
the O

The O

even O

among O

. O

It O
was O
the O
presence O
of O
these O
last O
two O

groups O
that O
would O
eventually O
stir O
up O

. O

Thanks O
in O
large O
part O
to O
the O
NCA B-ORG
, O
the O
art O
of O
the O
carousel O
was O
receiving O
a O

of O
public O

that O
it O
had O

before O

However O
, O
this O

on O
these O

had O
the O

dead O
( O

. O

As O
such O
, O
during O
the O
1980 O
's O
many O
beautiful O
and O
unique O
wooden O
carousels O
would O
be O
broken O
up O
at O
the O
auction O
block O
, O
as O
owners O
rushed O
to O
cash O
in O
on O
the O
antique O
marketplace O
. O

The O
liability O
insurance O
crisis O
further O
aggravated O
the O
situation O
, O
as O
amusement O
park O
operators O
sought O
to O
cut O
their O
losses O
, O
while O
at O
the O
same O
time O
liquidate O
underperforming O
carousels O
to O
raise O
capital O
for O
the O
purchase O
of O
newer O
and O
more O
profitable O
( O
thrill O
) O
rides O
. O

Some O
collectors O
of O
carousel O
art O
and O
auction O
houses O
were O
accused O
of O
using O
their O
NCA B-ORG
affiliation O
to O
gain O
information O
about O
vintage O
carousels O
that O
they O
could O
target O
for O
breakup O
to O
their O
own O
personal O
profit O
, O
a O
practice O
certainly O
contrary O
to O
the O
stated O
goals O
of O
the O
organization O
. O

The O
increasing O
rift O
between O
the O
`` O
preservationists O
'' O
and O
`` O
collectors O
'' O
would O
eventually O
boil O
over O
into O
an O
internal O
political O
struggle O
that O
caused O
many O
in O
the O
collectors O
faction O
of O
the O
NCA B-ORG
to O
walk O
out O
of O
the O
group O
, O
including O
founders O
such O
as O
Charlotte O
Dinger O
and O
others O
. O

The O
preservationists O
would O
chose O
to O
remain O
with O
the O
NCA B-ORG
, O
including O
Fred O
Fried O
. O

At O
this O
time O
in O
the O
late O
1970 O
's O
, O
carousel O
artwork O
collector O
and O
printer O
Marge O
Swenson O
was O
the O
editor O
of O
the O
NCA B-ORG
's O
Merry-Go-Roundup O
publication O
. O

The O
political O
struggle O
that O
occurred O
within O
the O
NCA B-ORG
resulted O
in O
two O
slates O
of O
officers O
being O
presented O
for O
approval O
to O
the O
membership O
, O
something O
that O
was O
not O
supposed O
to O
happen O
. O

A O
thicker-than-usual O
issue O
of O
the O
Roundup O
would O
be O
filled O
with O
accusations O
from O
both O
factions O
in O
the O
group O
each O
accusing O
the O
other O
of O
improper O
behavior O
. O

Swenson O
herself O
would O
also O
leave O
the O
NCA B-ORG
. O

Not O
much O
later O
, O
she O
began O
publishing O
her O
own O
magazine O
called O
`` O
Carousel O
Art O
'' O
, O
which O
was O
essentially O
a O
scholarly O
photo O
album O
depicting O
different O
carvers O
and O
styles O
each O
month O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
those O
collectors O
who O
left O
the O
National B-ORG
Carousel O
Association B-ORG
banded O
together O
to O
form O
the O
American B-ORG
Carousel O
Society B-ORG
( O
ACS B-ORG
) O
, O
whose O
stated O
aims O
of O
carousel O
preservation O
also O
recognized O
collectors O
as O
a O
positive O
asset O
towards O
that O
goal O
. O

For O
the O
next O
couple O
of O
decades O
, O
the O
two O
carousel O
organizations O
would O
co-exist O
, O
each O
attracting O
its O
share O
of O
members O
. O

Some O
would O
actually O
join O
both O
groups O
, O
and O
even O
attend O
both O
of O
their O
annual O
conventions O
. O

During O
the O
mid-1980 O
's O
Walter O
Louck O
would O
begin O
publishing O
`` O
The O
Carousel O
Trader O
'' O
, O
later O
renamed O
`` O
The O
Carousel O
News O
& O
amp O
; O
Trader O
'' O
. O

This O
monthly O
magazine O
would O
cover O
all O
angles O
and O
sides O
of O
the O
story O
of O
the O
carousel O
and O
be O
well O
received O
by O
all O
carousel O
enthusiasts O
. O

About O
a O
decade O
later O
, O
Carousel O
Art O
would O
suddenly O
cease O
publication O
. O

The O
NCA B-ORG
would O
continue O
to O
issue O
the O
Roundup O
to O
its O
members O
. O

The O
mid O
to O
late O
1990 O
's O
saw O
the O
passing O
of O
NCA B-ORG
founder O
Fred O
Fried O
, O
and O
also O
that O
of O
Charlotte O
Dinger O
, O
both O
who O
represented O
the O
two O
opposite O
points O
of O
view O
in O
the O
carousel O
preservation O
debate O
. O

Coincidentally O
and O
amazingly O
, O
the O
art O
of O
building O
hand-carved O
carousels O
( O
and O
even O
bandorgans O
) O
has O
been O
revived O
, O
with O
firms O
such O
as O
Carousel B-ORG
Works I-ORG
and O
Carousel B-ORG
Magic I-ORG
again O
building O
the O
popular O
rides O
in O
classic O
design O
. O

This O
development O
seems O
to O
have O
greatly O
alleviated O
the O
antique O
marketplace O
pressures O
that O
have O
doomed O
so O
many O
legacy O
wooden O
carousels O
over O
the O
past O
several O
decades O
. O

The O
turn O
of O
the O
new O
millenium O
actually O
witnessesed O
a O
thaw O
in O
the O
relationship O
between O
the O
National B-ORG
Carousel O
Association B-ORG
and O
American B-ORG
Carousel O
Society B-ORG
, O
as O
newer O
and O
younger O
leadership O
took O
over O
from O
the O
founding O
generation O
. O

The O
two O
groups O
decided O
that O
the O
bickering O
between O
them O
was O
wasteful O
, O
conterproductive O
and O
pointless O
. O

There O
was O
talk O
of O
a O
( O
re O
) O
merger O
but O
the O
regulations O
governing O
non-profits O
prevented O
that O
. O

However O
, O
it O
was O
decided O
that O
NCA B-ORG
and O
ACS B-ORG
hold O
joint O
conventions O
to O
save O
on O
costs O
to O
both O
the O
clubs O
and O
the O
members O
. O

Just O
within O
the O
past O
couple O
of O
months O
though O
, O
the O
American B-ORG
Carousel O
Society B-ORG
had O
determined O
that O
they O
did O
not O
have O
the O
funding O
to O
continue O
with O
the O
operation O
of O
their O
organization O
and O
officially O
ceased O
to O
exist O
. O

So O
now O
, O
once O
again O
there O
is O
a O
single O
nationwide O
organization O
to O
join O
if O
you O
love O
carousels O

Unless O
there O

something O

you O

I O
do O
n't O
see O
any O
reason O
to O
make O
this O
long O

I O
would O
suggest O
heading O
back O
to O
Red B-LOC
Bank I-LOC
or O
wherever O
and O
trying O
to O
carve O
out O
an O
extra O
day O
in O
New B-LOC
York O
City B-LOC
. O

You O
can O
find O
hotels O
in O
your O
price O
range O
, O
especially O
with O
three O
sharing O
a O

. O

You O
might O
want O
to O
drop O
off O
the O

somewhere O
near O
Red B-LOC
Bank I-LOC
, O
or O
as O
soon O
as O
you O
arrive O
in O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
, O
if O
the O
drop O
off O
charges O
are O
n't O
too O
much O
. O

Then O
you O
could O
spend O
part O
of O
one O
day O
in O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
( O
and O
a O
good O
part O
of O
the O
next O
day O
, O
assuming O
you O
dropped O
Toronto B-LOC
) O
. O

Then O
you O
could O
take O
the O
train O
or O
bus O
back O
to O
Boston B-LOC
. O

It O
might O
work O
out O
cheaper O
in O
the O
long O

, O
especially O
when O
you O
consider O
the O

Hi O
Everyone O
, O
Thanks O
for O
all O
the O
great O
replies O
! O
! O

This O
is O
exactly O
what O
I O
'm O
looking O
for O
: O
) O
The O
main O
reason O
I O
'd O
like O
to O
goto O
Toronto B-LOC
and O
Niagara B-LOC
Falls I-LOC
is O
mainly O
because O
it O
's O
so O
close.. O
but O
I O
agree O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
would O
be O
nice O
to O
spend O
a O
few O
days O
in O
. O

I O
know O
the O
bulk O
of O
our O
trip O
is O
in O
Boston B-LOC
, O
but O
we O
have O
friends O
living O
up O
there O
we O
hope O
to O
spend O
a O
few O
days O
with O
visiting O
. O

The O
trip O
is O
both O
to O
visit O
with O
them O
and O
to O
spend O
time O
around O
New B-LOC
England I-LOC
. O

As O
for O
gas O
, O
what O
is O
the O
going O
rate O
for O
gas O
right O
now O
in O
New B-LOC
England I-LOC
? O

Here O
in O
Texas B-LOC
it O
's O
around O
$ O
1.60- O
$ O
1.75 O
for O
Reg O
Unleadded O
, O
but O
i'm O
figuring O
$ O
1.90 O
a O
gallon O
. O

Is O
this O
not O
accurate O
? O

Here O
's O
how O
I O
figured O
the O
price O
I O
'm O
factoring O
in O
-- O
Boston B-LOC
to O
Niagara B-LOC
Falls I-LOC
- O
467 O
Miles O
Niagara B-LOC
Falls I-LOC
to O
Toronto B-LOC
- O
85 O
Miles O
and O
85 O
Miles O
back O
Niagara B-LOC

to O
Red B-LOC

, O
NJ B-LOC
- O
435 O
Miles O
Red B-LOC
Bank I-LOC
, O
NJ B-LOC
to O
Boston B-LOC
( O
plus O
spending O
some O
time O
in O
NYC B-LOC
) O
- O
262 O
Total O
is O
1334 O
, O
but O
I O
'm O
figuring O
1500 O
with O
some O
extra O
for O
around O
NYC B-LOC
and O
various O
towns O
we O
visit O
. O

We O
're O
getting O
a O
mid-sized O
vehicle O
, O
so O
if O
the O
car O
gets O
20 O
mpg O
that O
's O
75 O
gallons O
used O
. O

This O
times O
$ O
1.90 O
is O
$ O
145.50 O
or O
around O
that O
. O

Even O
if O
gas O
is O
$ O
2.00 O
a O
gallon O
that O
's O
still O
only O
around O
$ O
150 O
, O
so O
I O
think O
$ O
200+ O
for O
gas O
is O
a O
rather O
high O
estimate O
. O

Also O
is O
it O
possible O
to O
take O
a O
train O
from O
Boston B-LOC
to O
NYC B-LOC
? O

If O
so O
how O
does O
that O
work O
or O
what O
's O
the O
cost O
? O

I O
am O
from O
Texas B-LOC
where O
we O
drive O
everywhere O
, O
and O
I O
've O
never O
even O
set O
foot O
on O

so O
forgive O
me O
if O
this O
is O
a O
weird O
question O

all O
the O

Though O
I O

I O

always O
wanted O
to O

both O
Niagara B-LOC

Sunni O

the O

illegitimate O
because O
they O
chose O
not O

Fundamentally O
, O
choosing O
not O
to O
vote O
is O
actually O
a O
vote O
for O
the O
other O
side O
. O

If O
you O
choose O
not O
to O
vote O
, O
then O
you O
choose O
to O
give O
your O
opponents O
all O
the O
power O
. O

If O
the O
Sunni O
's O
were O
prevented O
, O
or O
restricted O
or O
otherwise O
not O
allowed O
to O
vote O
, O
then O
they O
could O
claim O
illegitimacy O
, O
but O
since O
the O
simply O
just O
collectively O
decided O
not O
to O
vote O
, O
then O
they O
declared O
the O
vote O
legitimate O
of O
their O
own O
volition O
whilest O
simultaneously O
ceding O
power O
to O
all O
non-Sunnis O
. O

If O
one O
slices O

one O

their O

then O
nobody O
should O
be O

If O

because O
FDR O

The O
thesis O
has O
been O
expounded O
by O
several O
conspiracy O
theorists O
, O
mainly O
the O
ones O
who O
expounded O
that O
FDR O
knew O
Pearl O
Harbor O
was O
about O
to O
be O
attacked O
, O
and O
let O
it O
happen O
. O

One O
of O
their O
`` O
proofs O
'' O
was O
that O
the O
US B-LOC
carriers O
were O
out O
of O
port O
during O
the O
attack O
, O
and O
`` O
everybody O
knew O
'' O
carriers O
were O
the O
capital O
ship O
of O
the O
future O
. O

However O
, O
the O
two O
carriers O
operating O
out O
of O
Pearl O
at O
the O
moment O
were O
sent O
West O
with O
light O
escort O
, O
on O
possibly O
intersecting O
routes O
with O
the O
IJN B-ORG
Kido O
Butai O
, O
which O
had O
far O
more O
carriers O
and O
a O
far O
heavier O
escort O
. O

Even O
stranger O
, O
the O
USS O
Enterprise O
was O
scheduled O
to O
be O
at O
Pearl O
by O
Dec O
6th O
, O
but O
got O
delayed O
by O
a O
storm O
. O

Consequently O
, O
for O
the O
PH O
conspiracy O
theorists O
to O
believe O
that O
FDR O
kept O
the O
carriers O
out O
of O
harm O
's O
way O
, O
we O
not O
only O
have O
to O
grant O
FDR O
the O
full O
knowledge O
of O
Kido O
Butai O
's O
route O
of O
approach O
would O
not O
result O
in O
either O
USN B-ORG
carrier O
fleet O
getting O
caught O
in O
a O
hopeless O
battle O
, O
but O
that O
FDR O
could O
psychically O
manipulate O
the O
weather O
to O
prevent O
Halsey O
from O
sailing O
into O
Pearl O
and O
thus O
be O
ambushed O
. O

To O
make O
a O
very O
long O
story O
short O
, O
it O
is O
foolish O
to O
assume O
that O
the O
US B-LOC
wanted O
to O
go O
to O
war O
against O
Japan B-LOC
prior O
to O
1941 O
, O
considering O
the O
weight O
of O
evidence O
arguing O
against O
a O
US B-LOC
desire O
for O
war O
, O
and O
the O
overwhelming O
lack O
of O
evidence O
( O
not O
to O

Here O

of O
a O
larger O
article O
, O
some O
while O

: O
Was O
n't O
Japan B-LOC
just O
defending O
herself O
when O
she O
attacked O
the O
US B-LOC
? O

This O
line O
of O
reasoning O
seems O
to O
derive O
from O
arguments O
that O
Japan B-LOC
was O
being O
'' O
driven O
into O
a O
corner O
'' O
by O
sanctions O
, O
and O
had O
no O
choice O
but O
to O
attack O
the O
US B-LOC
. O

Meiji B-LOC
Japan I-LOC
was O
driven O
to O
emulate O
what O
it O
thought O
the O
West B-LOC
was O
doing O
in O
every O
facet O
of O
society O
. O

They O
had O
observed O
, O
for O
example O
, O
that O
the O
West B-LOC
was O
able O
to O
carve O
up O
China B-LOC
into O
`` O
Spheres O
of O
Influence O
'' O
, O
and O
was O
able O
to O
do O
from O
great O
distances O
, O
while O
they O
, O
the O
Japanese B-LOC
, O
had O
had O
limited O
success O
in O
their O
previous O
attempts O
to O
dominate O
the O
Korean B-LOC
peninsula I-LOC
, O
much O
less O
China B-LOC
. O

As O
part O
of O
the O
catch-up O
effort O
, O
she O
whole-heartedly O
entered O
into O
the O
Imperialist O
game O
in O
Asia B-LOC

being O
treated O
as O
an O
equal O
( O
relative O
to O
her O
power O
) O
by O
the O
other O
powers O
. O

However O
, O
after O
World O
War O
I O
, O
Japan B-LOC
failed O
to O
recognize O
a O
fundamental O
shift O
in O
the O
attitudes O
of O
her O
former O
Imperial O
partners O
; O
they O
began O
a O
long O
, O
slow O
process O
of O
disengaging O
themselves O
from O
their O
former O
Imperial O
areas O
, O
from O
their O
colonies O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
outright O
stopping O
all O
expansions O
. O

Japan B-LOC
chose O
to O
read O
this O
as O
a O
sign O
that O
the O
West B-LOC
had O
lost O
its O
power O
and O
resolve O
, O
and O
that O
Japan B-LOC
was O
the O
rightful O
heir O
to O
Imperial O
mantle O
in O
Asia B-LOC
. O

With O
the O
deaths O
of O
many O
of O
the O
idealistic O
leaders O
who O
had O
led O
Japan B-LOC

rise O
to O
international O
prominence O
, O
and O
the O
refusal O
of O
the O
US B-LOC
to O
intervene O
in O
Asian B-LOC
affairs O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
Bolshevik O
revolution O
and O
the O
stripping O
of O
possessions O
from O
Germany B-LOC

Britain B-LOC
found O
herself O
alone O
in O
dealing O
with O
an O
increasingly O
aggressive O
Japan B-LOC
in O
the O
area O
. O

Having O
a O
keen O
grasp O
of O
the O
obvious O
, O
she O
began O
a O
policy O
of O
acceding O
to O
Japanese B-LOC
hegemony O
in O
the O
area O
. O

Japan B-LOC
continued O
a O
policy O
of O
acquiring O
territory O
for O
some O
grand O
, O
illusive O
scheme O
of O
a O
`` O
Greater B-LOC
Asia I-LOC
'' O
, O
subordinate O
and O
grateful O
to O
Japan B-LOC
. O

The O
reality O
of O
this O
was O
that O
only O
a O
single O
possession O
, O
Manchuria B-LOC
, O
was O
profitable O
to O
the O
Japanese B-LOC
, O
and O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
Empire O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
a O
drain O
. O

This O
drain O
was O
greatly O
accelerated O
by O
Japan B-LOC
's O
invasion O
of O
China B-LOC
proper O
in O
1936 O
. O

It O
was O
a O
war O
that O
Japan B-LOC
assumed O
would O
be O
ended O
in O
`` O
3 O

6 O
months O
'' O
; O
at O
the O
time O
of O

, O
it O
had O
been O
going O
on O
for O
5 O
years O
, O
at O
the O
cost O
of O
over O
half O
a O
million O
Japanese B-LOC
lives O
. O

The O
war O
put O
a O
tremendous O
strain O
on O
Japan B-LOC
( O
and O
was O
in O
fact O
opposed O
by O
more O
radically O
NATIONALISTIC O
elements O
, O
as O
taking O
away O
from O
the O
development O
of O
Japan B-LOC

in O
the O

) O

Domestic O

consumer O

, O
and O
the O
use O
of O

for O
war O
purposes O
ate O
into O
Japan B-LOC
's O
domestic O
industry O
. O

This O
cut O
further O
into O
her O
foreign O
reserves O
, O
exacerbating O
the O
economic O
impact O
of O
the O
war O
. O

The O
war O
effort O
took O
on O
a O
life O
of O
its O
own O
, O
however O
, O
and O
common O
sense O
was O
subordinated O
to O
it O
. O

Japan B-LOC
expanded O
into O
areas O
of O
China B-LOC
and O
Indochina B-LOC
which O
had O
no O
strategic O
value O
to O
her O
, O
but O
put O
her O
in O
a O
position O
to O
threaten O
British B-LOC
and O
Dutch B-LOC
possessions O
in O
the O
area O
; O
possessions O
that O
both O
those O
Allied B-LOC
nations O
needed O
in O
order O
to O
continue O
their O
fight O
against O
Hitler O
. O

At O
this O
point O
, O
the O
US B-LOC
stopped O
ignoring O
the O
Japanese B-LOC
threat O
, O
and O
imposed O
a O
series O
of O
escalating O
sanctions O
on O
Japan B-LOC
, O
cutting O
off O
her O
scrap O
metal O
, O
limitting O
and O
then O
cutting O
off O
her O
oil O
( O
Japan B-LOC
imported O
most O
of O
both O
from O
the O
US B-LOC
. O
) O

While O
Japanese B-LOC
officials O
realized O
that O
they O
had O
enough O
of O
each O
resource O
for O
Japan B-LOC
to O
do O
well O
IF O
THE O
WAR O
IN O
CHINA B-LOC
STOPPED O
, O
they O
were O
powerless O
over O
the O
military O
they O
were O
supposed O
to O
control O
. O

An O
abortive O
attack O
on O
Soviet B-LOC
positions O
in O
Mongolia B-LOC
had O
placed O
Japan B-LOC
's O
focus O
firmly O
south O
, O
towards O
the O
possessions O
of O
the O
US B-LOC
' O
future O
allies O
. O

For O
no O
reason O
anyone O
could O
articulate O
, O
Japan B-LOC
felt O
she O
had O
to O
continue O
the O
war O
in O
China B-LOC
. O

To O
continue O
the O
war O
in O
China B-LOC
, O
she O
had O
to O
have O
resources O
of O
oil O
and O
metal O
. O

To O
have O
these O
resources O
, O
she O
must O
seize O
them O
, O
if O
others O
refused O
to O

them O

it O

Such O

be O
based O
on O
the O

the O

got O

all O
the O

) O
were O
sufficient O
to O
bring O
him O
a O
majority O
in O
the O

The O
reason O
that O
Lincoln O
could O
get O
an O
electoral O
majority O
with O
only O
forty O
percent O
of O
the O
popular O
vote O
was O
not O
that O
his O
opposition O
was O
divided O
but O
that O
he O
had O
far O
fewer O
`` O

'' O
votes O
than O
his O
opponents O
-- O
in O
ten O
southern O
states O
he O
got O
no O
popular O

at O
all O
. O

It O
can O
of O
course O
be O
argued O
that O
the O
candidate O
of O
a O
united O
anti-Lincoln O
opposition O
might O
have O
done O
better O
than O
all O
the O
OTL O

, O
because O
the O
mere O
fact O
of O
the O
divided O
nature O
of O
Lincoln's O

might O
have O
discouraged O
anti-Lincoln O
men O
and O
led O
to O
fewer O

would O
otherwise O
be O
the O
case O

But O
given O
that O
turnout O
was O
quite O
high O
in O

, O
I O
doubt O
this O
. O

One O
thing O
seems O
reasonably O
clear O
to O
me O
: O
if O
there O

, O
Douglas O
could O
not O
lead O
it O

He O
was O
hated O
too O
much O
in O
the O
South B-LOC
for O
his O
opposition O
to O
the O
admission O
of O
Kansas B-LOC
as O
a O
state O
under O
the O
pro-slavery O
Lecompton O

for O

I O

The O
Holocaust O
of O
the O
Jews O

was O
motivated O
by O
racial O
prejudices O
. O

The O
murder O
of O
( O
at O
the O
most O

10k O
homosexuals O
was O
n't O
. O

Most O
homosexuals O
arrested O
during O
the O
Nazi O
era O
were O
imprisoned O
in O
normal O

. O

If O
you O
were O

but O
did O
nothing O
with O
it O
the O
law O
in O
30s O
Germany B-LOC

touch O
you O

The O
Jews O
and O
Zigeuner O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
were O

for O
their O

areas O

Scott O
More O
than O
a O

have O

remarked O
on O
the O
horrible O
hunting O

on O

that O
left O

and O
why O
I O
have O

ASSAULT O

I O
did O
n't O
mean O
to O
wait O
this O
long O
and O
never O
intended O
to O
ignore O
the O
issue O
, O
but O
I O
have O
been O
extremely O
busy O
last O
week O
with O
Thanksgiving O
and O
everything O
that O
goes O
along O
with O
it O
. O

This O
is O
problem O
that O
needs O
to O
be O
addressed O
. O

But O
as O
for O
the O
assault O
weapons O
ban O
issue O
, O
the O
man O
accused O
of O
the O
brutal O
killings O
, O
Chai O

Paul B-LOC

used O
a O
Russian-built B-LOC
Saiga O
7.62 O
mm O
, O
SKS O
semiautomatic O
rifle O
. O

As O
this O
article O
points O
out O
, O
the O
SKS O
was O
n't O
included O
on O
the O
list O
of O
banned O
weapons O
as O
part O
of O
the O
10-year O
ban O
on O
certain O
`` O
assault O
weapons O
'' O
signed O
by O
President O
Clinton O
. O

The O
ban O
expired O
in O
September O
and O
at O
the O
time O
of O
this O
posting O
, O
no O
one O
has O
been O
killed O
by O
any O
one O
of O
those O
weapons O
since O
the O
ban O
expired O
. O

But O
let O
's O
talk O
about O
this O
case O
, O
as O
I O
'm O
sure O
discussions O
have O
started O
and O
many O
want O
stronger O
gun O
control O
because O
of O
this O
freak O
incident O

While O
the O
media O
use O
words O
like O
`` O
military O
style O
, O
'' O
`` O
assault O
'' O
and O
'' O
semiautomatic O
, O
'' O
the O
gun O
used O
in O
the O
slayings O
was O
not O
unlike O
a O
typical O
hunting O
rifle O
. O

The O
SKS O
is O
a O
medium-powered O
carbine O
equipped O
with O
a O
10-round O
magazine O
, O
just O
like O
the O
pistol O
I O
'm O
displaying O
in O
the O
photo O
on O
the O
left O

side O
of O
this O
blog O

Banned O
weapons O
had O
capacities O
of O
more O
than O
10 O
rounds O
; O
so O
like O
my O
small O
9mm O
, O
the O
SKS O
was O
not O
classified O
as O
an O
`` O
assault O
'' O
weapon O
. O

So O
let O
's O
not O
center O
our O
discussion O
around O
the O
gun O
, O
let O
's O
talk O
about O
the O
person O
behind O
the O
trigger O
. O

If O
convicted O
of O
the O
killings O
, O
Vang O
faces O
life O
in O
prison O
as O
Minnesota B-LOC
does O
not O
honor O
the O
death O

I O
look O
forward O
to O
Vang O
's O
conviction O
and O
I O
pray O
for O
the O
families O
of O
the O

What O

tells O
us O
two O
things O

that O

it O

Spottswood O

Among O
some O

it O
is O
indeed O
a O
matter O

But O
you O
could O
say O
the O
same O
thing O
of O
the O
Democratic B-ORG

as O
a O
whole O
. O

I O
think O
it O
's O
important O
to O
recognize O
that O
African O
Americans O
, O
though O
still O
overwhelmingly O
Democratic O
, O
comprise O
less O
of O
a O
monolith O
than O
they O
did O
20-30 O
years O
ago O
. O

I O
find O
myself O
continually O
amazed O
at O
how O
open-minded O
many O
young O
African-Americans O
are O
. O

And O
I O
think O
that O
open-mindedness O
goes O
a O
long O
way O
to O
explain O
the O
desperate O
efforts O
of O
many O
( O
not O
all O
, O

many O
) O
within O
the O
Democratic B-ORG

to O
circle O

with O
the O
cry O

'' O

when O
the O

It O

like O
how O
, O
after O

`` O

, O
associating O
the O
Democratic B-ORG

, O
ultimately O
, O
the O
war O
itself O

Eventually O
, O
that O

to O
the O

way O
that O

He O
has O
suggested O
that O
we O
either O
increase O
membership O
in O
the O
Senate B-ORG
to O
50 O
, O
or O
decrease O

membership O

producing O
a O
scenario O

1 O
Senator O
would O

He O

Of O

, O
the O
Americans O

Governor O

one O
in O

Warner O

plan O

raise O

diversity O

short O

The O
article O
is O
full O
of O
innuendo O
that O

officals O
are O
ignoring O
the O
Governor O

wishes O

just O
waiting O
for O
him O

that O
`` O

that O
somehow O
the O

`` O

If O
true O

these O
are O
serious O
charges O

worthy O
of O

What O
's O
missing O

the O

is O
any O
attempt O
at O
investigative O

to O
give O
even O
one O

the O

What O

also O
missing O
is O
a O
fair-minded O
review O
of O
whether O
the O
sagging O
numbers O
reported O
for O
SWAM O
procurement O
are O
valid O

Someday O
a O
journalist O
is O
going O

take O
the O
time O
to O
watch O
a O
sample O
number O
of O
SWAM B-ORG

then O
use O
procurement O
tools O
that O

in O
place O
to O
determine O
if O
any O
SWAM B-ORG
firms O
were O
unfairly O
denied O
contracts O
they O
deserved O
. O

Until O
then O
, O
this O
carping O
appears O
to O
be O
sour O
grapes O

Governor O
Warner O
has O
done O
plenty O
to O
open O
up O
the O

SWAM B-ORG

give O
them O
a O
presumptive O
advantage O

even O
inviting O

Barghouti O

one O

the O
major O
leaders O
of O
the O
First O
Intifada O
in O
1987 O
, O
leading O
Palestinians O
in O
a O
mass O
uprising O
against O
Israeli B-LOC
occupation O
of O
the O

During O
the O
uprising O
, O
he O
was O
arrested O
by O
Israel B-LOC

deported O
to O
Jordan B-LOC

where O
he O
stayed O
for O
seven O
years O

the O
terms O
of O
the O
Oslo B-LOC
Accords O

In O
1996 O
, O
he O
was O
elected O
to O
the O
Palestinian B-ORG
Legislative O
Council B-ORG
, O
in O
which O
he O
advocated O
peace O
with O
Israel B-LOC

sometimes O
coming O
in O
conflict O
with O
Yasser O
Arafat O

The O
formal O
position O
occupied O

Barghouti O
was O
the O
General O
Secretary O

the O
West B-LOC
Bank I-LOC

By O
the O
summer O
of O

, O
Barghouti O
and O
Arafat O
had O
grown O
increasingly O
at O
odds O
with O
each O
other O

with O
Barghouti O
accusing O
Arafat O

administration O
of O
corruption O

his O
security O
services O
of O
human O

and O
Arafat O

fire O
him O
shortly O

However O
, O
as O
the O

Barghouti O
became O
increasingly O
popular O
as O
a O
leader O
of O
the O
Fatah B-ORG
Tanzim O

This O
was O

had O
been O
evacuated O
, O
everybody O
who O
could O
talk O
was O
questioned O
about O
their O
health O
. O

When O
the O
medics O
came O
to O
the O
two O
Iraqis O
, O
the O
ING B-ORG
soldiers O
only O
wanted O
to O
know O
how O
everybody O
else O
was O
. O

When O
asked O
why O
did O
they O
do O
it O
, O
they O
simply O
stated O
, O
`` O
this O
was O
our O
duty O
; O
we O
are O
a O
team O
, O
and O
we O
take O
care O
of O
each O

Even O
the O
Americans O

No O

what O
the O

tries O
to O
tell O
you O
, O
there O
are O
Iraqi's O
who O
will O
help O

who O
will O

them O
and O
put O
their O
lives O
at O

to O
make O
sure O
Democracy O
succeeds O
in O
their O
country O
. O

This O
brings O
to O
mind O
a O
speech O
Prime O
Minister O
Tony O
Blair O
gave O
recently O
while O
visiting O
Iraq B-LOC
. O

When O
I O
meet O
the O
people O
working O
alongside O
the O
United B-ORG
Nations I-ORG
-- O
Iraqis O
in O
fear O
of O
their O
life O
every O
day O
, O
because O
they O
are O
trying O
to O
bring O
freedom O
and O
democracy O
to O
their O
people O
-- O
when O
I O
see O
their O
courage O
and O
their O
determination O
and O
know O
that O
they O
speak O
for O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
people O
in O
Iraq B-LOC
who O
want O
that O
democracy O
and O
freedom O
, O
then O
I O
know O
that O
we O
are O
doing O
the O
right O
thing O
. O

. O

. O

. O

And O
I O
will O
also O
say O
this O
to O
you O
: O
There O
are O
people O
dying O
in O
Iraq B-LOC
, O
but O
the O
reason O
people O
are O
dying O
is O
because O
of O
the O
terrorism O
and O
the O
intimidation O
and O
the O
people O
who O
are O
deliberately O
killing O
anyone O
trying O
to O
make O
this O
country O
better O
. O

Now O
what O
should O
our O
response O
be O
as O
an O
international O
community O
? O

Our O
response O
should O
be O
to O
stand O
alongside O
the O
democrats O
-- O
the O
people O
who've O
got O
the O
courage O
to O
see O
this O
thing O
through O
-- O
and O
help O
them O
see O
it O
through O
. O

I O
've O
got O
no O
doubt O
at O
all O
that O
that O
is O
the O
right O
thing O
for O
us O
to O
do O
. O

. O

. O

. O

Sometimes O
when O
I O
see O
some O
of O
the O
reporting O
of O
what O
's O
happening O
in O
Iraq B-LOC
in O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
world O
, O
I O
just O
feel O
that O
people O
should O
understand O
how O
precious O
what O
has O
been O
created O
here O
is O
. O

And O
those O
people O
from O
that O
electoral O
commission O
that O
I O
described O
as O
the O
heroes O
of O
the O
new O
Iraq O
-- O
every O
day O
. O

. O

. O

a O
lot O
of O
them O
are O
n't O
living O
in O
the O
Green B-LOC
Zone I-LOC
, O
they O
've O
got O
to O
travel O
in O
from O
outside O

They O
do O
not O
know O
at O
any O
point O
in O
time O
whether O
they O
're O
going O
to O
be O
subject O
to O
brutality O
or O
intimidation O
, O
even O
death O
, O
and O
yet O
they O
carry O
on O
doing O
it O
. O

Now O
what O
a O
magnificent O
example O
of O
the O
human O
spirit O
-- O
that O
's O
the O
side O
we O
should O

Curt O
This O
recent O
news O
story O
is O
troubling O
in O
many O
different O
ways O
. O

When O
I O
first O
heard O
of O
the O
story O
I O
figured O
it O
was O
some O
wackjob O
playing O
with O
a O
new O
toy O
but O
now O
we O
find O
out O
there O
have O
been O
7 O
incidents O
since O
Christmas O
from O
the O
West O
to O
East O
coast O
. O

The O
FBI B-ORG
, O
concerned O
that O
terrorists O
could O
use O
lasers O
as O
weapons O
, O
is O
investigating O
why O
laser O
beams O
were O
directed O
into O
the O
cockpits O
of O
seven O
airplanes O
in O
flight O
since O
Christmas O
. O

Laser O
beams O
can O
temporarily O
blind O
or O
disorient O
pilots O
and O
possibly O
cause O
a O
plane O
to O
crash O
. O

The O
FBI B-ORG
is O
looking O
into O
two O
incidents O
in O
Colorado B-LOC

and O
one O
each O
in O

N.J. B-LOC

, O
according O
to O
federal O
and O
local O
law O
enforcement O
and O
transportation O
officials O
, O
some O
of O
whom O
spoke O
only O
on O
condition O
of O
anonymity O
. O

A O
federal O
law O
enforcement O
official O
, O
who O
declined O
to O
be O
identified O
by O
name O
, O
said O
Thursday O
there O
is O
no O
evidence O
of O
a O
plot O
or O
terrorist O
activity O
. O

But O
pilots O
are O
troubled O
by O
the O
incidents O
, O
and O
the O
FBI B-ORG
earlier O
this O
month O
warned O
of O
the O
possibility O
that O
terrorists O
might O
use O
the O
devices O
as O
weapons O
. O

`` O
It O
's O
not O
some O
kid O
, O
'' O
said O
Paul O
Rancatore O

a O

who O
serves O
as O

of O
the O
security O
committee O
for O
the O

`` O
It O

too O
organized O

'' O

Loren O
Thompson O
, O
who O
teaches O
military O
technology O
at O
Georgetown B-ORG
University I-ORG
, O
called O
it O
a O
`` O
rather O
worrisome O
development O
, O
'' O
though O
he O
said O
experts O
would O
be O
more O
puzzled O
than O
alarmed O
. O

`` O
What O
we O
're O
talking O
about O
is O
a O
fairly O
powerful O
visible O
light O
laser O
that O
has O
the O
ability O
to O
lock O
onto O
a O
fast-moving O
aircraft O
, O
'' O
Thompson O
said O
. O

`` O
That O
's O
not O
the O
sort O
of O
thing O
you O
pick O
up O
at O
a O
military O
surplus O
store O
. O
'' O

Thompson O
said O
a O
piece O
of O
equipment O
that O
could O
do O
the O
things O
the O
FBI B-ORG
suspects O
would O
be O
`` O
fairly O
expensive O
and O
fairly O
sophisticated O

'' O

`` O
It O
sounds O
like O
an O
organized O
effort O
to O
cause O
airline O
accidents O

'' O
Thompson O
said O
. O

Michelle O
Malkin O
has O
a O
post O
about O
this O
today O
where O
some O
outlets O
have O
stopped O
selling O
lasers O
. O

Lots O
of O
people O
think O
that O
these O
indeed O
might O
be O
loonies O
playing O
with O
new O
Christmas O
toys O
but O
I O
disagree O
. O

These O
are O
incidents O
where O
the O
Airplanes O
were O
tracked O
, O
some O
as O
high O
as O
8500 O
feet O
. O

To O
track O
a O
fast O
moving O
plane O
at O
that O
altitude O
would O
not O
be O
some O
toy O
you O
can O
get O
from O
the O
local O
wal-mart B-ORG
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
this O
is O
quite O
alarming O
. O

This O
Is O
n't O
Writing O
, O
It O

Typing O

a O
great O
post O
out O
with O
a O
ton O
of O
info O
, O
some O
of O
it O
quite O
scary O
A O
more O
frightening O
scenario O
is O
that O
terrorists O
may O
have O
obtained O
a O
Chinese-produced B-LOC
ZM-87 O
laser O
blinder O
which O
is O
specifically O
designed O
to O
blind O

The O

'' O

PoliticAlex O
also O
has O
some O
info O
on O
this O
story O
also O
. O

I O
found O
the O
following O
report O
that O
was O
presented O
to O
Congress B-ORG
recently O
about O
the O
shoulder O
launched O
missle O
threat O
to O
airliners O
, O
which O
this O
might O
very O
well O
be O
a O
precursor O
to O
: O
Recent O
events O
have O
focused O
attention O
on O
the O
threat O
that O
terrorists O
with O
shoulder O
fired O
surface-to-air O
missiles O
( O
SAMs O
) O
, O
referred O
to O
as O
Man-Portable O
Air O
Defense O
Systems O
( O
MANPADS O
) O
, O
pose O
to O
commercial O
airliners O
. O

Most O
believe O
that O
no O
single O
solution O
exists O
to O
effectively O
mitigate O
this O
threat O
. O

Instead O
, O
a O
menu O
of O
options O
may O
be O
considered O
, O
including O
installing O
infrared O
( O
IR O
) O
countermeasures O
on O
aircraft O
; O
modifying O
flight O
operations O
and O
air O
traffic O
control O
procedures O
; O
improving O
airport O
and O
regional O
security O
; O
and O
strengthening O
missile O
non-proliferation O
efforts O
. O

Equipping O
aircraft O
with O
missile O
countermeasure O
systems O
can O
protect O
the O
aircraft O
even O
when O
operating O
in O
areas O
where O
ground-based O
security O
measures O
are O
unavailable O
or O
infeasible O
to O
implement O
. O

However O
, O
this O
option O
has O
a O
relatively O
high O
cost O
, O
between O
$ O
1 O
million O
and O
$ O
3 O
million O
per O
aircraft O
, O
and O
the O
time O
needed O
for O
implementation O
does O
not O
allow O
for O
immediate O
response O
to O
the O
existing O
terrorist O
threat O
. O

Procedural O
improvements O
such O
as O
specific O
flight O
crew O
training O
, O
altering O
air O
traffic O
procedures O
to O
minimize O
exposure O
to O
the O
threat O
, O
and O
improved O
security O
near O
airports O
may O
be O
less O
costly O
than O
countermeasures O
and O
could O
more O
immediately O
help O
deter O
domestic O
terrorist O
attacks O
. O

However O
, O
these O
techniques O
by O
themselves O
can O
not O
completely O
mitigate O
the O
risk O
of O
domestic O
attacks O
and O
would O
not O
protect O
U.S B-LOC
. O

airliners O
flying O
to O
and O
from O
foreign O
airports O

introduced O
in O

Curt O
American O
Future O
has O
a O
link O
up O
to O
a O
article O
written O
in O
yesterdays O
Houston B-ORG
Chronicle I-ORG
. O

It O
describes O
how O
the O
European B-LOC
Governments O
look O
to O
be O
changing O
their O
tune O
in O
regards O
to O
President O
Bush O
. O

Why O
you O
ask O
? O

But O
there O
is O
arguably O
more O
to O
this O
sea O
change O
than O
just O
a O
grumpy O
acceptance O
of O
the O
status O
quo O
. O

From O
a O
European B-LOC
perspective O
, O
three O
things O
are O
making O
it O
easier O
to O
warm O
to O
the O
Bush O
White B-ORG
House I-ORG
. O

One O
is O
the O
death O
of O
Yasser O
Arafat O
. O

No O
issue O
divides O
Europe B-LOC
and O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
more O
keenly O
than O
the O
Israeli-Palestinian B-LOC
dispute O
. O

For O
the O
last O
few O
years O
, O
Europeans O
have O
criticized O
Bush O
for O
failing O
to O
put O
enough O
pressure O
on O
Israel B-LOC
to O
get O
out O
of O
the O
occupied O
territories O
and O
for O
refusing O
to O
deal O
with O
Arafat O
. O

That O
another O
reason O
why O
I O
respect O
Bush O
so O
much O
, O
his O
refusal O
to O
acknowledge O
that O
windbag O
terrorist O
Arafat O
. O

May O
he O
rot O
in O
hell O
. O

But O
since O
Arafat O
's O
death O
, O
Europeans O
and O
Americans O
have O
been O
able O
to O
find O
common O
ground O
: O
supporting O
Ariel O
Sharon O
's O
withdrawal O
from O
Gaza B-LOC
, O
putting O
pressure O
on O
Israel B-LOC
to O
let O
the O
Palestinians O
hold O
elections O
and O
, O
covertly O
, O
backing O
Mahmoud O
Abbas O
to O
become O
the O
next O
Palestinian B-LOC
leader O
. O

A O
second O
reason O
is O
Europe B-LOC
's O
growing O
worries O
about O
Islamic O
terrorism O
. O

The O
murder O
in O
November O
of O
Theo O
van O
Gogh O
, O
a O
provocative O
Dutch B-LOC
filmmaker O
, O
at O
the O
hands O
of O
an O
Islamic O
militant O
has O
been O
called O
Europe B-LOC
's O
9/11 O
. O

Though O
the O
two O
events O
are O
obviously O
not O
fully O
comparable O
, O
it O
is O
certainly O
true O
that O
American B-LOC
conservatives O
, O
such O
as O
Francis O
Fukuyama O
and O
Bernard O
Lewis O
, O
have O
found O
a O
wider O
audience O
recently O
for O
the O
idea O
that O
radical O
Islam O
is O
inimical O
to O
European B-LOC
traditions O
of O
tolerance O
. O

You O
mean O
those O
radical O
muslims O
can O
be O
kinda O
nasty O
sometimes O
? O

Get O
outta O
here O
... O
.Keep O
doing O
business O
like O
the O
cowards O
in O
Spain B-LOC
and O
they O
will O
more O
then O
likely O
have O
their O
very O
own O
9/11 O
to O
cry O
about O
. O

The O
third O
force O
is O
the O
reappearance O
, O
albeit O
in O
a O
milder O
form O
, O
of O
the O
threat O
that O
kept O
the O
trans-Atlantic O
alliance O
together O
for O
half O
a O
century O
. O

The O
Russian B-LOC
bear O
is O
growling O
again O
. O

The O
Ukrainian B-LOC
election O
-- O
- O
complete O
with O
its O
KGB-style B-ORG
poisoning O
of O
the O
opposition O
leader O
and O
heavy-handed O
electoral O
fraud O
-- O
has O
reminded O
European B-LOC
diplomats O
of O
Vladimir O
V. O
Putin O
's O
determination O
to O
control O
his O
`` O
near O
abroad O
. O
'' O

They O
should O
be O
very O
worried O
about O
this O
item O
, O
I O
believe O
Putin O
is O
slowly O
sliding O
Russia B-LOC
back O
to O
what O
it O
once O
was O
. O

Hopefully O
our O
Government O
is O
n't O
asleep O
at O
the O
wheel O
with O
this O
situation O
either O
. O

There O
is O
a O
personal O
edge O
to O
all O
this O
. O

Just O
as O
the O
snooty O
continentals O
eventually O
came O
to O
admire O
the O
gormless O
Hollywood B-ORG
actor O
, O
there O
is O
a O
grudging O
willingness O
to O
rethink O
some O
prejudices O
about O
the O
inarticulate O
Texan O
. O

Many O
European B-LOC
leaders O
once O
swallowed O
the O
Michael O
Moore O
version O
of O
history O
: O
that O
Bush O
was O
an O
ignorant O
interloper O
who O
stole O
the O
White B-ORG
House I-ORG
. O

His O
thumping O
re-election O
, O
however O
, O
shows O
that O
he O
represents O
a O
large O
body O
of O
conservative O
American O
opinion O
. O

In O
short O
, O
Europeans O
are O
getting O
used O
to O
the O
idea O
that O
it O
is O
not O
Bush O
who O
is O
the O
exception O
, O
but O
the O
U.S B-LOC
. O

itself O
that O
is O
exceptional O
-- O
- O
and O
that O
if O
they O
want O
to O
deal O
with O
this O
exceptional O
superpower O
they O
need O
to O
humor O
it O
rather O
than O
rile O

Yup O

you O

that O
right O

Kofi's O
performance O
is O
soooooo O
impressive O
. O

Gag O

Guess O
the O
democrats O
have O
their O
own O
Armstrong O
conspiracy O
to O
deal O
with O
. O

Why O
would O
an O
NBC B-ORG

( O
who O
also O
reports O

U.N B-ORG

for O
National B-ORG
Public O
Radio B-ORG
) O
take O
money O
from O
the O
U.N B-ORG

lobby O
? O

Perhaps O
because O
longtime O
NBC B-ORG
News O
anchor O
Tom O
Brokaw O
put O
his O
stamp O
of O
approval O
on O
the O
UNA-USA B-ORG

BCUN B-ORG
by O
acting O
as O
master O
of O

Not O
surprisingly O
, O
Brokaw O
is O
listed O
on O
the O
Fasulo O
book O

as O
saying O
it O
is O
a O
`` O
must-read O
. O
'' O

Another O
endorsement O
of O
the O
book O
comes O
from O
Barbara O
Crossette O
, O
former O
New B-ORG

bureau O

at O

U.N B-ORG

, O
a O
Ted O
Turner-funded O
online O
news O
service O
that O
covers O
the O
U.N B-ORG
. O

A O
fascinating O
part O
of O
the O
book O
is O
how O
Fasulo O
manages O
to O
gloss O
over O
Annan O
's O
role O
in O
the O
1994 O
genocide O
in O
Rwanda B-LOC
. O

She O
tries O
to O
blame O
the O
U.S B-LOC
. O

and O
other O
members O
of O
the O
Security B-ORG
Council I-ORG
for O
not O
sending O
enough O
troops O
to O
stop O
it O
. O

She O
admits O
, O
however O
, O
that O
, O
`` O
The O
Rwanda B-LOC
massacres O
occurred O
while O
Annan O
was O
U.N B-ORG
. O

Undersecretary O
General O
for O
peacekeeping O
, O
'' O
and O
that O
`` O
After O
he O
became O
SG O
[ O
Secretary O
General O
] O
, O
Annan O
commissioned O
a O
report O
to O
examine O
what O
had O
happened O
and O
suggest O
remedies O
. O
'' O

Later O
, O
`` O
Annan O
accepted O
responsibility O
for O
failing O
to O
act O
more O
quickly O
, O
'' O
she O
writes O
. O

But O
responsibility O
for O
what O
? O

The O
truth O
is O
that O
, O
as O
director O
of O
U.N B-ORG
. O

peacekeeping O
, O
Annan O
personally O
refused O
requests O
to O
authorize O
U.N B-ORG
. O

peacekeepers O
in O
Rwanda B-LOC
to O
seize O
weapons O
and O
prevent O
genocide O
. O

Writer O
and O
author O
Philip O
Gourevitch O
has O
described O
in O
detail O
how O
, O
three O
months O
before O
the O
genocide O
, O
Major O
General O
Romeo O
Dallaire O
, O
the O
commander O
of O
several O
thousand O
U.N B-ORG
. O

troops O
in O
Rwanda B-LOC
, O
sent O
a O
fax O
to O
Kofi O
Annan O
's O
office O
, O
saying O
he O
had O
received O
evidence O
from O
a O
Rwandan B-LOC
government O
informant O
that O
genocide O
was O
being O
planned O
. O

The O
informant O
offered O
to O
help O
U.N B-ORG
. O

forces O
in O
raiding O
the O
government O
stockpiles O
to O
be O
used O
in O
the O
genocide O
campaign O
. O

All O
that O
the O
informant O
wanted O
in O
return O
was O
protection O
for O
himself O
and O
his O
family O
. O

But O
the O
general O
needed O
U.N B-ORG
. O

authorization O
to O
conduct O
such O
a O
raid O
and O
save O
lives O
. O

He O
asked O
for O
that O
approval O
but O
the O
answer O
came O
back O
in O
a O
now-infamous O
`` O
genocide O
fax O
'' O
from O
Annan O
's O
office O
. O

It O
denied O
authorization O
for O
the O
mission O
and O
told O
him O
that O
he O
should O
turn O
the O
information O
provided O
by O
the O
confidential O
witness O
over O
to O
the O
Rwandan B-LOC
government O
which O
was O
planning O
the O
genocide O
! O

The O
result O
was O
that O
the O
information O
dried O
up O
and O
the O
genocide O
took O
place O
. O

Yup O
, O
good O
ole O
Kofi O
told O
this O
poor O
guy O
to O
give O
the O
secret O
info O
over O
to O
the O
very O
government O
that O
was O
planning O
the O
genocide O
. O

What O
a O
great O

he O
is O
is O

he O

Or O
how O
about O
the O
ongoing O
prostitution O
that O
's O
going O
on O
in O
the O
Congo B-LOC

Now O
the O
report O

out O

The O

the O

: O
In O
an O
April O
30 O

2001 O

Nat O

when O

who O
could O

prevented O
the O
slaughter O
of O
800,000 O
Tutsis O
and O
their O
sympathizers O
in O
Rwanda B-LOC
in O
1994 O
. O
'' O

It O
's O
true O
, O
Hentoff O
said O
, O
that O
the O
U.N B-ORG
. O

issued O
a O
report O
in O
1999 O
that O
acknowledged O
, O
to O
some O
extent O
, O
its O
role O
in O
the O
killings O
. O

But O
for O
five O
and O
a O
half O
years O
, O
he O
noted O
, O
Annan O
`` O
refused O
to O
accept O
any O
responsibility O

'' O

It O
is O
astonishing O
that O
a O
journalist O
for O
NBC B-ORG
New O
would O
close O
her O

... O
A O
European B-LOC
diplomat O
said O
the O
issue O
of O
calling O
Hezbollah B-ORG
a O

was O
discussed O
in O
Brussels B-LOC

Some O

it O
sound O
as O
if O
the O
reason O

are O
hesitant O

go O
along O

because O
of O
the O
situation O

But O
as O
The O
Captain O
points O
out O
, O
it O
probably O
has O
more O
to O
do O
with O
Iran B-LOC
: O
I O
suspect O
the O
true O
reason O
for O
the O
reluctance O
comes O
not O
from O
the O
'' O
delicate O
'' O
nature O
of O
Lebanese B-LOC
politics O
, O
but O
from O
the O
relationship O
between O
Hezbollah B-ORG
and O
the O
Iranians O
. O

The O
EU B-ORG
has O
tried O
for O
the O
past O
two O
years O
to O
appease O
the O
Iranian B-LOC
mullahs O
into O
giving O
up O
their O
nuclear-weapons O
ambitions O

little O
avail O

They O
do O

want O

rock O
the O

now O

attempting O

starve O
out O
the O
mullahs O
' O
terror O
agent O

the O
proxy O
attacks O
against O
Israel B-LOC
that O
Iran B-LOC
can O
not O
afford O
to O
do O
itself O
openly O
. O

They O
did O
not O
learn O
from O
Hitler O
's O
Germany B-LOC
I O
guess O
, O
they O
tried O
to O
appease O
that O
guy O
too O
. O

This O
whole O
thing O
just O
reminds O
me O
how O
corrupt O
and O
useless O
France B-LOC

They O
will O
forever O

keep O
the O

SEC B-ORG

Game O
in O
December O
, O
Georgia B-ORG
must O
beat O
Auburn B-ORG

This O
game O
is O
as O
good O
as O
it O
gets O
. O

Sure O
, O
Auburn B-ORG
's O
in-state O
rival O
is O
Alabama B-ORG
, O
but O
year O
in O
and O
year O
out O
, O
this O
game O
, O
the O
Auburn-UGA B-ORG
game O
, O
seems O
like O
the O
one O
that O
matters O
more O
. O

I O
seldom O
if O
ever O
root O
for O
Bama B-ORG
, O
but O
I O
always O
root O
for O
UGA B-ORG
to O
be O
undefeated O
when O
the O
play O
Auburn B-ORG
. O

The O
game O
is O
big O
enough O
already O
, O
but O
it O
seems O
even O
bigger O
when O
one O
or O
both O
teams O
have O
something O
on O
the O
line O
. O

Yes O
, O
both O
teams O
have O
other O
games O
left O
to O
play O
and O
yes O
, O
other O
teams' O
results O
may O
affect O
what O
happens O
to O
both O
of O
these O
teams O
, O
but O
in O
just O
five O
days O
, O
these O
two O
teams O
will O
play O
the O
biggest O
and O
most O
important O
game O
of O
their O
season O

So O
now O
it O
's O
time O
for O
all O
of O
the O
yapping O
and O
jawing O
and O
talking O

that O
goes O

Except O
I O
do O

that O

I O
ca O

do O
that O

Anytime O
I O
try O
to O

, O
I O
get O
all O
nauseous O
and O
worry O
about O
what O
happens O
not O
if O
but O
WHEN O
we O
lose O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
it O

just O
me O
or O
if O
being O
this O
pragmatic O
is O
what O
it O
means O
to O
be O
an O
Auburn B-ORG
fan O
. O

I O
wonder O
if O
deep O
down O
THIS O
is O
what O
it O
feels O
like O
to O
be O
a O
Red B-ORG

I O

I O

, O
enough O

at O

EVERYTHING O

pro-UGA B-ORG

I O
mean O
, O
I O
knew O
it O
would O
be O
, O
but O
some O
of O
it O
was O
even O
based O
on O
facts O

Like O
this O
beauty O
: O
When O
Auburn B-ORG

their O

are O
both O
in O
the O
top O
ten O
, O
Auburn B-ORG
is O
4-6-1 O
in O

Auburn B-ORG

three O

that O
scenario O

Auburn B-ORG

, O

AT O

with O
the O

winning O
about O
two-thirds O

The O
only O
time O
this O
changed O

was O

On O

Auburn B-ORG

33 O
points O

six O

That O
's O
a O
pretty O

run O
. O

Auburn B-ORG
leads O
the O
SEC B-ORG
in O
scoring O
offense O
, O
scoring O
defense O
and O

Auburn B-ORG
is O
second O
in O
the O
nation O
in O

seventh O
in O

Jason O

Here O
are O
a O
couple O
of O
middle O
of O
the O

stats O
: O
Auburn B-ORG

Quentin O
Groves O
and O
Georgia B-ORG
's O
David O
Pollack O
are O
tied O
for O
the O
SEC B-ORG

. O

Here O
's O
the O
biggest O
for O
what O
it O
's O
worth O
stat O
as O
far O
as O
I O
am O
concerned O
: O
both O
teams O
are O
undefeated O
this O
year O
when O
scoring O
first O
. O

Auburn B-ORG
is O
8-0 O
and O
UGA B-ORG
is O
5-0 O
. O

I O
'd O
say O
that O
's O
the O
biggest O
stat O
right O
now O
. O

Auburn B-ORG
's O
offense O
is O
potent O
and O
efficient O
. O

UGA B-ORG
's O
defense O
is O
relentless O
and O
contains O
a O
couple O
of O
the O
country O
's O
biggest O
hitters O
, O
especially O
Greg O
Blue O
and O
Odell O
Thurman O
. O

Auburn B-ORG
's O
defense O
is O
fast O
and O
relentless O
and O
the O
DB O
's O
are O
experienced O
and O
big O
. O

UGA B-ORG
's O
receivers O
are O
leaders O
, O
with O
one O
of O
them O
a O
team O
captain O
. O

Auburn B-ORG
's O
two O
running O
backs O
are O
seniors O
and O
very O
experienced O
and O
dangerous O
, O
bruising O
backs O
. O

UGA B-ORG
's O
two O
backs O
are O
smaller O
freshmen O
with O
less O
experience O
, O
but O
are O
dangerous O
as O
well O
. O

In O
my O
mind O
, O
the O
game O
is O
going O
to O
turn O
on O
a O
few O
key O
points O
, O
some O
obvious O
and O
some O
not O
. O

Here O
goes O
the O
prediction O
machine O
: O
- O
Turnovers O
( O
as O
always O
) O
will O
be O
critical O
. O

- O
Special O
teams O
play O
and O
lack O
of O
special O
teams O
mistakes O
will O
tell O
the O
tale O
regarding O
field O
position O
. O

- O
Both O
teams O
MUST O
establish O
the O
run O
to O
be O
successful O
. O

If O
Auburn B-ORG
goes O
for O
150 O
between O
their O
two O
backs O
, O
they O
're O
almost O
impossible O
to O
beat O
. O

Conversely O
, O
Georgia B-ORG
MUST O
be O
able O
to O
run O
the O
ball O
to O
set O
up O
play O
action O
and O
keep O
the O
pressure O
off O
of O
David O
Greene O
. O

- O
Mark O
Richt O
has O
proven O
to O
be O
a O
better O
on O
the O
fly O
adjustment O
coach O
that O
Tommy O
Tuberville O
. O

Tubs O
is O
famous O
for O
taking O
chances O
, O
often O
unnecessary O
ones O
. O

That O
history O
is O
of O
concern O
to O
me O
. O

While O
it O
's O
okay O
to O
try O
crazy O
shit O
when O
your O
team O
is O
under-rated O
or O
a O
serious O
underdog O
, O
it's O
important O
not O
to O
give O
games O
away O
when O
you O
're O
the O
favorite O
. O

Playing O
more O
'' O
by O
the O
book O
'' O
and O
a O
bit O
`` O
closer O
to O
the O
vest O
'' O
becomes O
the O
call O
for O
the O
day O
. O

Considering O
all O
of O
these O
factors O
, O
I O
truly O
believe O
that O
this O
is O
Auburn B-ORG
's O
year O
. O

They O
may O
not O
go O
undefeated O
and O
they O
may O
not O
get O
into O
the O
BCS B-ORG
title O
game O
, O
but O
they O
have O
enough O
talent O
, O
poise O
and O
experience O
to O
win O
this O
game O
. O

Auburn B-ORG
wins O
31-21 O
. O

And O
now O
that O
I O
have O
typed O
that O
prediction O
, O
I O
may O
just O
throw O
up O
in O
my O

All O

about O

Mark O
Backer O
Well O
, O
it O
's O
mid-morning O
on O
the O
East B-LOC
coast I-LOC
and O
I O
am O
sitting O
here O
running O
numbers O
thru O
my O
head O
trying O
to O
figure O
out O
what O
's O
going O
to O
happen O
in O
the O
Iron O
Bowl O
, O
which O
is O
just O
over O
29 O
hours O
away O
. O

The O
game O
is O
being O
played O
in O
Tuscaloosa B-LOC
, O
which O
should O
be O
an O
advantage O
to O
Alabama B-ORG
. O

However O
, O
In O
the O
two O
times O
the O
game O
has O
been O
played O
in O
Bryant O
Denny O
Stadium O
, O
Auburn B-ORG
has O
won O
. O

Alabama B-ORG
has O
one O
of O
the O
stingiest O
defenses O
in O
the O
country O
, O
and O
were O
ranked O
number O
one O
in O
overall O
defense O
as O
recently O
as O
last O
week O
. O

Conversely O
, O
Auburn B-ORG
has O
one O
of O
the O
most O
potent O
and O
balanced O
offensive O
attacks O
in O
the O
nation O
. O

Also O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
Bama B-ORG
has O
faced O
an O
attack O
with O
two O
great O
runners O
, O
a O
great O
line O
, O
a O
poised O
QB O
and O
good O
receivers O
and O
a O
tight O
end O
as O
well O
. O

Bama B-ORG
is O
missing O
it O
's O
starting O
offensive O
backfield O
from O
the O
start O
of O
the O
season O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
they O
've O
won O
six O
games O
is O
a O
testament O
to O
the O
coaching O
and O
heart O
of O
the O
players O
. O

Alabama B-ORG
simply O
can O
not O
throw O
the O
football O
, O
which O
is O
a O
good O
thing O
, O
because O
Auburn B-ORG
's O
defensive O
backfield O
is O
second O
to O
none O
. O

Bama B-ORG
can O
run O
the O
ball O
however O
. O

Unfortunately O
for O
them O
, O
with O
no O
passing O
game O
to O
keep O
the O
defense O
honest O
, O
Auburn B-ORG
will O
probably O
stack O
nine O
in O
the O
box O
, O
play O
man O
on O
the O
corners O
, O
and O
dare O
Bama B-ORG
to O
run O
, O
and O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
they O
'll O
be O
able O
to O
do O
it O
. O

Auburn B-ORG
is O
also O
9-0 O
when O
they O
score O
first O
. O

The O
Tuberville O
way O
is O
to O
get O
one O
quick O
and O
early O
to O
get O
your O
crowd O
into O
it O
if O
you O
're O
at O
home O
and O
to O
quiet O
the O
other O
team O
's O
crowd O
if O
you O
're O
on O
the O
road O
. O

You O
can O
never O
tell O
what O
is O
going O
to O
happen O
in O
rivalry O
games O
. O

In O
this O
exact O
game O
15 O
years O
ago O
, O
Bama B-ORG
came O
into O
Auburn B-LOC
# O
2 O
in O
the O
country O
, O
undefeated O
at O
10-0 O
and O
looking O
for O
yet O
another O
national O
championship O
. O

They O
were O
summarily O
trounced O
30-20 O
in O
a O
game O
in O
which O
the O
score O
was O
closer O
than O
the O
actual O
game O
. O

That O
could O
very O
well O
happen O
Saturday O
. O

I O
always O
tell O
people O
that O
the O
Georgia B-ORG
game O
matters O
more O
to O
me O
than O
the O
Bama B-ORG
game O
. O

I O
live O
in O
Georgia B-LOC
, O
and O
losing O
that O
game O
affects O
me O
much O
more O
directly O
than O
losing O
the O
Alabama B-ORG
game O
. O

That O
said O
, O
when O
kickoff O
time O
comes O
, O
you O
remember O
all O
the O
reasons O
that O
you O
hate O
Alabama B-ORG
and O
their O

their O

everything O

that O

the O

's O
wife O
and O
then O
bragged O
about O
it O

It O
's O
THAT O

However O
, O
when O
it O
's O
all O
said O
and O
done O
, O
I O
just O
do O
n't O
think O
Alabama B-ORG

the O
horses O
to O
stand O
up O
to O
what O
I O
believe O
is O
going O
to O
be O
enormous O
defensive O
pressure O
. O

If O
Auburn B-ORG
takes O
care O
of O
the O
ball O
and O
executes O
, O
this O
game O
should O
n't O
be O
as O
close O
as O
some O

We O
spent O

Saturday O
was O
busy O

The O

Not O

The O
looked O
good O

15 O

then O
they O

I O
have O
no O
beef O
with O

Mark O

Apparently O
Jason O
Giambi O
, O
recently O
the O
non-playing O
and O
`` O
sick O
'' O
first O
baseman O
of O
the O
New B-ORG
York O
Yankees B-ORG

admitted O
to O
a O
Grand O
Jury O
that O
he O
'' O
injected O
anabolic O
steroids O
and O
human O
growth O
hormone O
( O
HGH O

as O
recently O
as O

And O
he O

( O

the O
same O
guy O
that O
is O

' O

once O
Greg O

Since O

Giambi O
repeatedly O
denied O
using O
any O

anything O

that O

Jason O

Gary O

one O
by O

the O
lesser O

players O
in O
this O

are O
seeing O
their O
testimony O
coming O
into O
the O
the O
public O
eye O
where O
they O
admitted O
that O
they O
DID O
do O

It O
seems O
that O
anyone O
associated O
with O
this O
special O
`` O
trainer O
'' O
Greg O
Anderson O
is O
coming O
up O
dirty O
. O

It O
's O
a O
good O
thing O
that O
Major B-ORG
League O
Baseball B-ORG
has O
such O
a O
tough O
steroid O
policy O

or O
this O

may O

our O
attention O

( O

Never O

if O
the O

were O
illegal O
in O

or O
not O

They O
are O
illegal O

I O
want O
to O
know O
where O
the O
Federal O

Anyone O

The O

that O
these O

denying O
it O
implicitly O
and O
acting O
like O
the O
person O

is O
appalling O

These O

are O
messing O

people O

they O
're O

lied O
about O

yet O
when O
it O
turns O
out O
the O

were O
n't O
lying O

the O

were O

nothing O
is O
done O

I O
have O
never O
denied O
that O
Barry O
Bonds O
was O
a O
special O

gifted O
athlete O

Whether O
it O

lighter O

using O

perform O
at O
this O

for O
this O
length O

defies O
logic O

That O

why O
it O

a O
shame O
that O
, O
in O
the O
final O
analysis O

all O
of O

numbers O

are O
going O
to O
be O
ignored O

lumped O
into O
the O
statement O
`` O

It O

a O

now O

just O

you O

the O
one O

here O

I O
read O
today O
: O
A O
man O
takes O
his O
Rottweiler O
to O
the O
vet O
and O
says O
, O
`` O
My O
dog O
's O
cross-eyed O
, O
is O
there O
anything O
you O
can O
do O
for O
him O
? O
`` O

`` O
Well O
, O
'' O
says O
the O
vet O
, O
`` O
let O
's O
have O
a O
look O
at O
him O
. O
'' O

So O
he O
picks O
the O
dog O
up O
and O
examines O
his O
eyes O
, O
then O
checks O
his O
teeth O
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
vet O
says O
`` O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
have O
to O
put O
him O
down O
. O
'' O

`` O
What O
? O

Because O
he O
's O
cross-eyed O
? O
'' O

`` O
No O
, O
because O
he O
's O
really O
heavy O
. O
'' O

I O
will O
be O
breaking O
down O
the O
SEC B-ORG
championship O
game O
either O
later O
today O

so O
I O

won O

A O
year O

Since O
that O
day O
, O
the O
team O
is O
undefeated O
and O
has O
won O
14 O
games O
in O
a O
row O
. O

They O
have O
now O
beated O
four O
teams O
that O
were O

the O

USC B-ORG
won O
by O
five O
over O
a O
shitty O
UCLA B-ORG
team O
with O
a O
6-5 O
record O
, O
and O
that O
was O
thanks O
in O
part O
to O
an O
official O
who O
blew O
dead O
a O
clear O
and O
obvious O
fumble O
that O
would O
have O
been O
returned O
for O
a O
UCLA B-ORG

Oklahoma B-ORG

a O

Colorado B-ORG

The O
result O
was O
a O
40 O

what O
did O
anyone O
expect O
? O

Auburn B-ORG

was O
attempting O
to O
do O
one O
of O
the O
toughest O
things O
to O
do O
in O
college O
football O
: O
beating O
a O
team O
twice O
in O
the O
same O
year O
. O

With O
the O
exception O
of O
a O
15 O
yard O
shanked O
punt O
and O
a O
punt O
snap O
that O
Kody O
Bliss O
missed O
while O
having O
an O
apparent O
thrombosis O
, O
Auburn B-ORG
led O
21-7 O
at O
the O
half O
and O
had O
held O
UT B-ORG
to O
46 O
yards O
of O
offense O
. O

While O
the O
Auburn B-ORG
running O
game O
was O
held O
up O
, O
Jason O
Campbell O
threw O
it O
all O
over O
the O
ball O
field O
and O
, O
when O
his O
receivers O
were O
covered O
, O
he O
ran O
for O
yardage O
on O
his O
own O
. O

This O
despite O
several O
late O
hits O
to O
the O
head O
, O
low O
hits O
at O
his O
knees O
and O
ankles O
, O
and O
various O
other O
assaults O
outside O
the O
realm O
of O
good O
sportsmanship O
. O

Tennessee B-ORG
scored O
on O
a O
pass O
play O
that O
was O
incorrectly O
ruled O
a O
touchdown O
, O
since O
the O
ball O
clearly O
touched O
the O
turf O
, O
and O
that O
's O
where O
the O
momentum O
of O
the O
game O
changed O
. O

I O
think O
it O
was O
also O
at O
that O
point O
that O
the O
scoreboard O
began O
to O
reflect O
Auburn B-ORG
's O
last O
title O
hopes O
dying O
as O
the O
Oklahoma-Colorado B-ORG
score O
would O
have O
begun O
showing O
the O
beat-down O
that O
was O
occuring O
. O

Auburn B-ORG
was O
tied O
21-21 O
and O
in O
jeapordy O
of O
losing O
it O
most O
important O
game O
ever O
, O
but O
senior O
QB O
Jason O
Campbell O
would O
have O
none O
of O
it O
. O

Auburn B-ORG
won O
going O
away O
38-28 O
, O
and O
the O
only O
place O
the O
game O
looked O
close O
was O
on O
the O
scoreboard O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
believe O
that O
an O
undefeated O
SEC B-ORG
team O
is O
not O
playing O
for O
a O
title O
, O
but O
I O
guess O
we O
can O
thank O
Jeff O
Sagarin O
and O
the O
other O
dicks O
that O
keep O
voting O
USC B-ORG
number O
one O
to O
make O
up O
for O
what O
happened O
to O
them O
last O
year O
. O

All O
I O
know O
is O
that O
they O
better O
think O
that O
way O
next O
year O
, O
because O
it O
's O
Auburn B-ORG
that O
got O
screwed O
this O
year O
. O

And O
what O
's O
better O
is O
that O
Auburn B-ORG
gets O
to O
play O
one O
of O
the O
three O
hottest O
teams O
in O
the O
country O
in O
my O
opinion O
. O

Virginia B-ORG
Tech I-ORG
is O
talented O
, O
very O
athletic O
and O
one O
of O
the O
most O
well O
coached O
teams O
in O
the O
country O
and O
they O
WILL O
come O
to O
play O
on O
January O
3rd O
. O

I O
hope O
our O
kids O
can O
shake O
off O
this O
travesty O
and O
focus O
on O
making O
the O
pollsters O
look O
like O
idiots O
. O

Maybe O
an O
Oklahoma B-ORG
win O
in O
a O
butt-ugly O
game O
and O
a O
great O
Auburn B-ORG
performance O
could O
help O
. O

Sorry O
I O
have O
n't O
been O
posting O
much O
lately O
. O

We O
have O
been O
so O
damned O
busy O
with O
the O
holidays O
( O
that O
's O
what O
we O
call O
December O
at O
our O
house O
) O
that O
I O
just O
have O

I O
read O
a O
funny O
joke O
today O
and O
I O
thought O
I O
'd O
share O
it O
with O
you O
. O

One O
of O
my O
fellow O
eggers O
posted O
it O
, O
so O
Chet O
, O
here O
's O
your O
credit O
: O
A O
traveler O
was O
driving O
through O
Arkansas B-LOC
when O
he O
lost O
his O
way O
and O
got O
off O
the O
main O
highway O
. O

As O
he O
drove O
by O
, O
he O
saw O
rows O
and O
rows O
of O
pigsties O
and O
pigpens O
and O
pigs O
running O
in O
fields O
and O
pigs O
wallowing O
in O
mud O
. O

Suddenly O
, O
his O
eye O
caught O
something O
really O
strange O
. O

He O
did O
a O
double O
take O
, O
muttered O
to O
himself O
and O
then O
looked O
a O
third O
time O
. O

He O
wondered O
if O
he O
had O
seen O
correctly O
- O
it O
looked O
like O
a O
pig O
with O
a O
wooden O
leg O
! O

He O
found O
the O
lane O
to O
the O
farm O
and O
drove O
up O
into O
the O
farmyard O
, O
where O
he O
was O
met O
by O
the O
farmer O
. O

`` O
Excuse O
me O
, O
'' O
the O
traveler O
said O
. O

`` O
I O
was O
just O
driving O
by O
and O
looking O
at O
all O
your O
pigs O
, O
and O
I O
noticed O
something O
that O
I O
just O
had O
to O
stop O
and O
ask O
about O
. O

Tell O
me O
, O
did O
I O
see O
right O
? O

Is O
there O
really O
a O
pig O
out O
there O
with O
a O
wooden O
leg O
? O
'' O

The O
farmer O
smiled O
. O

`` O
Oh O
, O
that O
would O
be O
old O
Caesar O
you O
saw O
. O

He O
's O
the O
finest O
pig O
a O
man O
could O
ever O
hope O
to O
have O
- O
and O
smart O
! O

Well O
, O
let O
me O
tell O
you O
a O
little O
about O
that O
pig O
. O

You O
see O
that O
barge O
down O
there O
on O
the O
river O
? O

That O
's O
a O
mining O
dredge O
, O
taking O
out O
platinum O
ore. O
Old O
Caesar O
sniffed O
out O
the O
vein O
and O
showed O
us O
how O
to O
set O
it O
up O
. O

Now O
that O
dredge O
brings O
me O
in O
about O
$ O
120,000 O
every O
year O
. O

`` O
There O
's O
another O
thing O
, O
too O
, O
a O
little O
more O
personal O
. O

One O
night O
a O
couple O
of O
years O
ago O
I O
got O
to O
drinking O
and O
I O
guess O
I O
had O
more O
than O
I O
should O
have O
. O

I O
passed O
out O
drunk O
, O
fell O
down O
and O
knocked O
over O
a O
lamp O
. O

That O
started O
a O
fire O
in O
the O
house O
and O
old O
Caesar O
smelled O
the O
smoke O
. O

He O
came O
in O
the O
back O
door O
, O
got O
the O
wife O
and O
kid O
out O
, O
roused O
me O
up O
and O
got O
me O
out O
. O

`` O
There O
is O
no O
question O
about O
it O
- O
that O
night O
old O
Caesar O
saved O
all O
our O
lives O
and O
you O
know O
that O
is O
not O
the O
sort O
of O
thing O
a O
man O
is O
going O
to O
forget O
too O
easily O
. O
'' O

`` O
Why O
, O
'' O
the O
traveler O
said O
, O
`` O
this O
is O
all O
amazing O
! O

I O
have O
never O
heard O
of O
a O
pig O
like O
this O
before O

This O
is O
fantastic O
! O

But O
tell O
me O
, O
how O
did O
he O
get O
that O
wooden O
leg O
? O

Was O
he O
in O
a O
wreck O
or O
something O
? O
'' O

The O
farmer O
laughed O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Well O
, O
naturally O
, O
when O
you O
have O
a O
pig O
that O

you O
do O

him O

I O
do O

normally O

about O
pro O
football O

but O
what O
I O
saw O
deserved O
a O
ranting O
or O
two O
, O
and O
I O
suspect O
it O
's O
going O
to O
get O
many O
more O
in O
the O
days O
and O
weeks O
to O
come O
. O

With O
4:41 O
left O
in O
the O
fourth O
quarter O
and O
the O
Packers B-ORG
down O
by O
11 O
, O
Favre O
hit O
Robert O
Ferguson O
with O
a O
31 O
yard O
strike O
near O
the O
left O
hash O
marks O
. O

Coming O
from O
the O
other O
direction O
, O
Jacksonville B-ORG
DB O
Donovin O
Darius O
unloaded O
chin O
high O
on O
Ferguson O
with O
a O
vicious O
clothesline O
. O

Remarkably O
, O
Ferguson O
held O
on O
to O
the O
ball O
, O
despite O
being O
disjoined O
from O
his O
helmet O
on O
the O
hit O
. O

After O
many O
minutes O
lying O
motionless O
on O
the O
field O
, O
Ferguson O
was O
finally O
removed O
via O
stretcher O
, O
giving O
a O
thumbs O
up O
to O
the O
crowd O
on O
the O
way O
out O
. O

The O
Packers B-ORG
went O
on O
to O
lose O
the O
game O
, O
but O
that O
's O
not O
the O
story O
here O
. O

This O
was O
not O
one O
of O
the O
staged O
stiff-armed O
clotheslines O
you O
see O
in O
professional O
wrestling O
broadcasts O
. O

This O
was O
a O
vicious O
, O
arm O
cocked O
and O
swinging O
clothesline O
that O
literally O
could O
have O
torn O
Ferguson O
's O
head O
off O
of O
his O
body O
. O

The O
play O
was O
immediately O
flagged O
, O
and O
moments O
later O
it O
was O
announced O
that O
Darius O
had O
been O
ejected O
, O
much O
to O
the O
crowd O
's O
delight O
. O

One O
sidenote O
here O
is O
that O
, O
despite O
their O
rabid O
fandom O
and O
the O
situation O
, O
not O
one O
thing O
was O
thrown O
at O
the O
offending O
player O
as O
he O
left O
the O
field O
. O

It O
would O
have O
been O
easy O
to O
bathe O
him O
in O
beer O
or O
snowballs O
or O
batteries O
as O
he O
left O
, O
but O
the O
Packer B-ORG
fans O
are O
classier O
than O
that O
. O

To O
a O
person O
, O
they O
acted O
with O
class O
, O
using O
their O
voices O
and O
not O
projectiles O
to O
express O
their O
displeasure O
. O

This O
was O
the O
most O
vicious O
and O
blatantly O
dirty O
play O
I O
have O
seen O
in O
the O
NFL B-ORG
since O
Jim O
McMahon O
was O
body O
slammed O
to O
the O
ground O
in O
the O
mid O
80's O
about O
five O
seconds O
after O
he O
had O
released O
a O
pass O
. O

And O
Jaguars B-ORG
coach O
Jack O
Del O
Rio O
and O
Darius O
had O
the O
nerve O
to O
vociferously O
argue O
with O
officials O
about O
Darius O
' O
ejection O
from O
the O
game O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
care O
what O
anyone O
says O
about O
`` O
you O
ca O
n't O
judge O
intent O
. O
'' O

Darius' O
intent O
was O
to O
dismember O
, O
injure O
or O
even O
kill O
Ferguson O
. O

The O
more O
I O
saw O
the O
replay O
, O
the O
sicker O
it O
made O
me O
feel O
. O

The O
league O
must O
take O
action O
, O
and O
it O
must O
be O
swift O
and O
sure O
. O

I'm O
talking O
about O
a O
four O
game O
suspension O
that O
included O
the O
playoffs O
if O
necessary O
. O

In O
this O
day O
and O
age O
of O
bigger O
, O
stronger O
and O
faster O
players O
, O
injuries O
are O
going O
to O
happen O
accidentally O
all O
of O
the O
time O
. O

There O
is O
simply O
no O
room O
for O
the O
kind O
of O
play O
that O
resulted O
in O
Ferguson O
's O
injury O
. O

Paul O
Tagliabue O
must O
give O
word O
to O
all O
of O
his O
employees O
that O
actions O
like O
this O
will O
not O
be O
tolerated O
. O

Maybe O
that O
will O
tell O
the O
Jaguars B-ORG
, O
Darius O
and O
players O
like O
him O
that O
this O
kind O
of O
head-hunting O
will O
not O
be O
tolerated O
in O
the O
NFL B-ORG
. O

If O
not O
, O
I O
fully O
expect O
the O
Packers B-ORG
and O
many O
other O
teams O
to O
handle O
this O
matter O
`` O
on O
the O
field O
'' O
with O
Darius O

the O
target O
of O
similar O
attacks O
by O
tight O

's O
a O
little O
disappointing O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
this O
worked O
out O
about O
as O
well O
as O
it O
could O
. O

If O
you O
asked O
me O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
year O
if O
I O
'd O
rather O
be O
8-3 O
and O
playing O
in O
the O
liberty O
bowl O
or O
12-0 O
with O
a O
chance O
to O
win O
the O
Sugar O
Bowl O
, O
go O
13-0 O
and O
finish O
second O
, O
I O
'd O
say O
hell O
yeah O
to O
the O
latter O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
pundits O
put O
OU B-ORG
ahead O
of O
Auburn B-ORG
based O
on O
their O
out O
of O
conference O
schedule O
being O
tougher O
than O
ours O
is O
laughable O
now O
. O

In O
the O
end O
, O
playing O
Bowling B-ORG
Green I-ORG
over O
us O
playing O
The B-ORG
Citadel I-ORG
did O
n't O
make O
the O
Sooners B-ORG
much O
better O
. O

Man O
, O
I O
've O
seen O
softer O
takedowns O
on O
Cops O
. O

USC B-ORG
came O
on O
to O
the O
field O
, O
gave O
up O
a O
TD O
, O
then O
decided O
to O
make O
Choke-lahoma B-ORG
their O
collective O
bitches O
, O
and O
they O
did O
just O
that O
. O

38-10 O
at O
the O
half O
meant O
that O
I O
did O
n't O
even O
have O
to O
hear O
that O
dying O
hyena O
Ashlee O
`` O
no O
, O
I O
'm O
the O
one O
with O
dark O
hair O
and O
no O
boobs O
'' O
Simpson O
butcher O
yet O
another O
song O
on O
tv O
. O

Hell O
, O
I O
read O
it O
on O
Fark B-ORG
this O
morning O
. O

Hooray O
for O
big O
first O
half O
beatings O
that O
get O
me O
an O
extra O
hour O
of O
sleep O
. O

We O
might O
not O
have O
won O
, O
but O
we O
would O
n't O
have O
let O
Leinert O
go O
long O
on O
us O
all O
night O
either O
. O

Our O
db O
's O
would O
have O
had O
something O
to O
say O
about O
that O
. O

And O
, O
it O
turns O
out O
that O
when O
playing O
a O
decent O
team O
, O
OU B-ORG
ca O
n't O
do O
shit O
on O
offense O
. O

That O
was O
just O
plain O
terrible O
. O

Jason O
White O
looked O
like O
Jason O
Voorhees O
out O
there O
, O
stomping O
around O
getting O
caught O
from O
every O
direction O
any O
time O
he O
did O
n't O
hand O
of O
to O
Peterson O
for O
a O
three O
yard O
loss O
. O

In O
five O
years O
, O
Oklahoma B-ORG
has O
played O
in O
four O
huge O
games O
, O
and O
lost O
three O
of O
them O
... O
badly O
. O

That O
must O
feel O
like O
being O
a O
Sox B-ORG
fan O
before O
this O
year O
, O
I O
'd O
imagine O
. O

Anyway O
, O
I O
feel O
great O
. O

Think O
about O
this O
. O

A O
year O
ago O
, O
Tuberville O
was O
one O
reporter O
's O
abililty O
to O
find O
an O
out O
of O
place O
airplane O
in O
Ohio B-LOC
away O
from O
being O
fired O
BEFORE O
the O
Alabama B-ORG
game O
. O

Then O
, O
the O
AD O
and O
President O
get O
canned O
, O
a O
booster O
starts O
down O
the O
long O
road O
to O
shun-ville O
, O
and O
Tuberville O
keeps O
smiling O
and O
saying O
the O
right O
things O
. O

He O
talks O
his O
two O
running O
backs O
and O
two O
stellar O
DB O
's O
into O
staying O
, O
then O
knocks O
out O
15 O
straight O
wins O
and O
signs O
one O
of O
those O
super O
iron-clad O
contracts O
that O
will O
pay O
him O
14 O
million O
over O
seven O
years O
, O
and O
if O
Auburn B-ORG
even O
thinks O
... O
THINKS O
about O
letting O
him O
go O
, O
they O
owe O
him O
every O
penny O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
even O
think O
there O
's O
a O
morality O
clause O
. O

He O
could O
have O
sex O
with O
an O
endangered O
Bald O
Eagle O
, O
and O
they O
'd O
STILL O
have O
to O
pay O
him O
. O

And O
that O
's O
the O
way O
it O
should O
be O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
Auburn B-ORG
fans O
can O
spend O
the O
next O
six O
months O
saying O
`` O
yeah O
, O
but O
we O
'd O
have O
done O
this O
'' O
or O
`` O
We O
were O
13-0 O
, O
won O
the O
sec O
, O
beat O
five O
top O
ten O
teams O
, O
three O
of O
them O
on O
the O
road O
, O
and O
became O
the O
only O
undefeated O
SEC B-ORG
team O
in O
the O
BCS B-ORG
's O
history O
to O
NOT O
play O
for O
the O
title O
. O
'' O

And O
coincidentally O
, O
Oklahoma B-ORG
's O
played O
in O
it O
this O
year O
, O
last O
year O
, O
and O
in O
2000 O
. O

You O
won O
in O
2000 O
, O
but O
you O
got O
punked O
the O
last O
two O
years O
, O
and O
last O
year O
you O
got O
to O
play O
for O
the O
title O
even O
though O
you O
did O
n't O
even O
win O
your O
conference O
. O

You O
got O
embarassed O
by O
Kansas B-ORG
State I-ORG
and O
LSU B-ORG
last O
year O
, O
and O
humiliated O
this O
year O
. O

But O
the O
little B-ORG
12 I-ORG
is O
SOOO O
much O
better O
than O
the O
SEC B-ORG
. O

That O
's O
why O
you O
played O
a O
four-loss O
team O
for O
your O
conference O
title O
this O
year O
. O

And O
, O
considering O
the O
BCS B-ORG
is O
run O
by O
the O
head O
of O
the O
Big B-ORG
12 I-ORG
, O
it O
's O
no O
wonder O
you O
get O
the O
benefit O
of O
the O
doubt O
. O

Do O
n't O
think O
so O
? O

How O
about O
the O
fact O
that O
only O
two O
teams O
that O
didn't O
win O
their O
conference O
have O
ever O
played O
for O
the O
national O
title O
? O

You O
and O
Nebraska B-ORG
in O
2001 O
. O

Oh O
, O
the O
other O
thing O
you O
two O
Big O
12 O
teams O
have O
in O
common O
is O
that O
you O
got O
your O
asses O
kicked O
on O
the O
sport O
's O
biggest O
stage O
. O

So O
yes O
, O
we O
are O
disappointed O
. O

But O
all O
you O
can O
do O
is O
play O
the O
schedule O
in O
front O
of O
you O
. O

Auburn B-ORG
did O
that O
with O
class O
and O
dignity O
, O
they O
won O
every O
game O
, O
faced O
down O
every O
challenge O
, O
and O
made O
every O
Auburn B-ORG
fan O
in O
the O
country O
and O
the O
world O
proud O
. O

War O
Eagle O
! O
! O

Now O
, O
can O
someone O
get O
the O
Auburn B-ORG
cheerleaders O
some O
of O
those O
USC B-ORG
sweaters O
? O

Meow O

Mark O

Much O

the O
`` O

everyone O

of O
The O
Harricks O
, O
folks O
around O
the O
Buckeye B-LOC

have O
to O
be O

It O

that O

Maybe O
it O

me O

but O
I O
'm O
guessing O
Andy O

tired O
of O
putting O
on O

makeup O
and O
going O
on O
the O

lying O
about O
what O

Tressel O
knew O
about O
their O
athletes O
in O
general O
and O
their O
football O
program O
in O
particular O
. O

It O
seems O
that O
Maurice O
Clarrett-gate O
just O
is O
n't O
going O
away O
. O

Two O
years O

, O
everyone O
was O
saying O
`` O
shame O

, O
Maurice O

You O
should O
have O
known O
better O
. O
'' O

Now O
, O
it O
seems O
like O
most O
folks O
are O
saying O
`` O
Shame O
on O
you O
both O
Andy O
and O
Jim O
. O

YOU O
both O
should O

'' O

Allegations O
have O
come O
to O
light O
that O
several O
OSU B-ORG
players O
received O
illegal O
benefits O
including O
cash O
, O
access O
to O
cars O
, O
etc O
. O

Now O
, O
I O
don't O
expect O
the O
AD O
and O
coach O
to O
know O
everything O
, O
but O
when O
a O
player O
is O
driving O
a O
brand O
new O
car O
every O
couple O
of O
weeks O
or O
months O
, O
well O
, O
somebody O
ought O
to O
jot O
a O
memo O
and O
get O
to O
the O
bottom O
of O
that O
. O

It O
should O
n't O
surprise O
Buckeye B-ORG
fans O
either O
, O
since O
Tressel O
had O
similar O
problems O
at O
Youngstown B-ORG
State I-ORG
, O
and O
left O
a O
wake O
of O
controversy O
behind O
himself O
there O
as O
well O
, O
including O
( O
surprise O
) O
illegal O
benefits O
including O
cash O
, O
cars O
, O
grade O
fixing O
, O
etc O
. O

Geiger O
is O
also O
tired O
from O
saying O
`` O
we O
did O
n't O
do O
anything O
wrong O
'' O
about O
his O
basketball O
program O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
it O
was O
discovered O
that O
his O
men's O
basketball O
coach O
had O
directly O
given O
six O
grand O
to O
a O
Yugoslavian B-LOC
recruit O
, O
but O
that O
was O
just O
his O
stipend O
for O
travel O
and O
coach O
Jim O
O'Brien O
was O
just O
having O
a O
problem O
with O
the O
currency O
exchange O
rates O
... O
right O
Andy O
? O

I O
only O
hope O
that O
the O
NCAA B-ORG
will O
do O
something O
they O
rarely O
do O
: O
make O
a O
good O
sound O
decision O
and O
take O
away O
Ohio B-ORG
State I-ORG
's O
national O
title O
from O
January O
2003 O

It O
seems O
they O
had O
a O
very O
important O
and O
very O
ineligible O
player O
that O
season O
, O
and O
maybe O
many O
. O

I O
'd O
hate O
to O
give O
another O
title O
to O
Thugtown O
Miami B-ORG
, O
but O
I O
'd O
give O
it O
to O
Alabama B-ORG

it O
was O
okay O
for O
Ohio B-ORG

Mark O

it O

Wednesday O
, O
Commissioner O
Gary O
Bettman O
announced O
the O
cancellation O
of O
the O
2004-2005 O
NHL B-ORG
season O
. O

As O
if O
everyone O
did O
n't O
already O
know O
that O
was O
the O
case O
. O

Shame O
on O
the O
NHL B-ORG
and O
shame O
on O
the O
players O
' O
association O
for O
not O
getting O
a O
deal O
done O
, O
but O
I O
put O
much O
more O
of O
the O
blame O
on O
the O
owners O
as O
this O
`` O
negotiation O
'' O
came O
down O
to O
the O
wire O
. O

I O
understand O
that O
the O
league O
was O
losing O
less O
money O
by O
not O
playing O
than O
it O
would O
have O
by O
having O
a O
season O
this O
year O
. O

I O
also O
understand O
that O
when O
push O
came O
to O
shove O
, O
the O
players O
gave O
in O
and O
accepted O
a O
salary O
cap O
. O

Okay O
, O
the O
sides O
were O
about O
7 O
million O
per O
team O
apart O
, O
but O
could O
n't O
they O
just O
say O
`` O
alright O
, O
let O
's O
split O
that O
in O
half O
and O
play O
hockey O
? O
'' O

I O
mean O
Holy O
Christ O
people O
, O
two O
kids O
arguing O
over O
10 O
bucks O
would O
work O
it O
out O
that O
way O
. O

Why O
is O
this O
any O
different O
? O

The O
NHL B-ORG
's O
primary O
goal O
was O
to O
get O
a O
salary O
cap O
approved O
by O
the O
players O
, O
and O
they O
finally O
did O
. O

And O
what O
did O
the O
NHL B-ORG
do O
when O
that O
momentus O
event O
occurred O
? O

They O
left O
the O
negotiating O
table O
. O

Gary O
Bettman O
is O
a O
mindless O
troll O
and O
the O
professional O
sports O
commissioner O
equivalent O
of O
Joe O
Hazelwood O
and O
this O
lockout O
/ O
strike O
/ O
cluster O
fuck O
is O
the O
reef O
. O

The O
first O
thing O
that O
needs O
to O
happen O
is O
that O
Bettman O
and O
Goodenow O
( O
the O
players B-ORG
' O
association B-ORG
rep O
) O
need O
to O
be O
fired O
, O
deported O
, O
flogged O
, O
tarred O
and O
feathered O
and O
finally O
forced O
to O
pay O
for O
four O
tickets O
plus O
a O
program O
, O
four O
dogs O
, O
four O
beers O
, O
and O
two O
cokes O
and O
parking O
to O
a O
game O
at O
an O
NHL B-ORG
arena O
for O
every O
day O
of O
the O
next O
season O
so O
they O
understand O
what O
the O
fans O
go O
thru O
to O
see O
a O
hockey O
game O
. O

Then O
, O
all O
current O
contracts O
need O
to O
be O
voided O
by O
the O
end O
of O
the O
season O
in O
2006 O
. O

That O
means O
no O
team O
would O
own O
any O
player O
, O
and O
the O
owners O
would O
be O
free O
to O
sign O
whomever O
they O
'd O
like O
using O
the O
`` O
fiscal O
restraint O
'' O
they O
all O
droned O
on O
and O
on O
about O
all O
year O
. O

That O
way O
, O
they O
'd O
only O
pay O
as O
much O
as O
they O
could O
afford O
... O
right O
? O

Wrong O
. O

Those O
douchebags O
would O
end O
up O
overspending O
like O
every O
professional O
sports O
owner O
because O
they O
ca O
n't O
control O
themselves O
. O

If O
Mr. O
Iginla O
or O
Heatley O
were O
free O
agents O
, O
for O
example O
, O
owners O
would O
bid O
each O
other O
out O
of O
their O
minds O
, O
then O
they O
'd O
be O
left O
with O
not O
enough O
to O
get O
a O
competetive O
team O
. O

While O
the O
business O
model O
in O
the O
NHL B-ORG
was O
certainly O
flawed O
and O
the O
owners O
needed O
help O
, O
they O
really O
needed O
help O
to O
protect O
them O
from O
themselves O
. O

And O
the O
fact O
is O
that O
without O
that O
help O
, O
the O
owners O
would O
follow O
the O
same O
path O
that O
got O
them O
where O
they O
are O
right O
now O
anyway O
. O

The O
biggest O
issue O
is O
this O
, O
however O
. O

Very O
few O
people O
give O
one O
hot O
shit O
whether O
the O
NHL B-ORG
plays O
another O
game O
ever O
, O
let O
alone O
this O
season O
or O
the O
next O
one O
. O

For O
every O
crying O
Canuck O
there O
are O
1,000 O
or O
more O
others O
who O
say O
'' O
No O
hockey O
? O

Huh O
... O
did O
n't O
even O
notice O
. O
'' O

And O
the O
last O
television O
network O
interested O
in O
carrying O
hockey O
( O
ESPN B-ORG
) O
may O
opt O
out O
of O
televising O
the O
NHL B-ORG
next O
season O
, O
meaning O
that O
all O
of O
the O
teams O
would O
be O
in O
HUGE O
trouble O
, O
because O
no O
TV O
= O
no O
league O
. O

Period O
. O

Atlanta B-LOC
lost O
the O
Flames B-ORG
25 O
years O
ago O
because O
, O
despite O
full O
houses O
every O
night O
, O
it O
's O
TV O
revenue O
that O
pays O
the O
freight O
and O
the O
Flames B-ORG
had O
no O
tv O
contract O
. O

Imagine O
an O
entire O
league O
with O
no O
TV O
contract O
. O

Hell O
, O
Major B-ORG
League O
Soccer B-ORG
and O
the O
WNBA B-ORG
DO O
have O
a O
tv O
contract O
and O
no O
one O
gives O
a O
shit O
about O
them O
. O

I O
'll O
say O
this O
for O
the O
NHL B-ORG
, O
when O
they O
screw O
up O
, O
they O
screw O
up O
huge O
. O

Congrats O
guys O
. O

You O
will O
forever O
be O
known O
as O
the O
generation O
that O
killed O
professional O

Netflix B-ORG
represents O
a O
pure-play O
on O
one O
of O
the O
three O

I O

That O

is O
O-V-E-R O

Between O

, O
pirated O
movies O
, O

the O

some O
faith O
to O
see O
any O
future O
for O

Those O
who O
do O
n't O
have O
the O
requisite O
faith O
will O
point O
to O
these O
factors O
as O
proof O
that O
the O
business O
is O
dying O
and O
the O
movie O
business O
in O
general O
will O
need O
a O
pretty O
significant O
overhaul O
before O
it O
can O
make O
profits O
. O

Movie O

are O
no O
longer O
a O
cheap O
alternative O
to O
other O
ways O
of O
viewing O
films O
; O
they O
're O
the O
stodgy O
, O
expensive O
way O
. O

There O
are O
n't O
any O
pure-play O
buys O

this O
theory O

someone O
who O

it O

overweight O
their O

Anyone O
who O
wants O
to O
counter O
that O
argument O
would O
probably O
start O
by O
taking O
us O
back O
to O
1997 O
, O
when O
in O
terms O
of O
time O
used O
, O

was O
the O
most O
popular O
kind O
of O

At O
the O
time O
, O
and O
for O
years O
after O
, O
people O
argued O
that O
the O
traditional O
bookstore O
would O
become O
obsolete O
. O

After O
all O
, O
how O
could O
we O
stand O
for O
a O
rapaciously O
arborcidal O
medium O

could O

You O

So O
there O
's O
a O
big O
difference O
between O
movies O
and O
books O
: O
For O
books O
, O
the O
retail O
store O
is O
practically O
the O
sole O
medium O
of O
distribution O
; O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
sell O
through O
them O
, O
books O
wo O
n't O
get O
sold O
. O

For O
movies O
, O
the O
video O
rental O
store O
is O
just O
one O
way O
to O
get O
videos O
out O
there O
( O
though O
at O
45-55 O
% O
of O
studio O
revenues O
, O
it O
's O
a O
much O
more O
important O
one O
than O
people O
think O
) O
. O

But O
given O
the O
high O

ascribed O
to O
bricks-and-mortar-and-dead O

there's O

for O
a O
Blockbuster B-ORG

along O
with O
a O
Movie B-ORG

or O

. O

The O
latter O
, O
at O

, O
still O
has O
room O
to O
grow O

By O
focusing O
on O
smaller O

The O

dramatically O
as O
the O

the O

As O
a O

WalMart B-ORG

expand O

beyond O
either O
their O

some O

After O
all O

adding O

One O
of O
the O
rules O
of O
thumb O
that O
has O
guided O
my O
( O
limited O
) O
business O
career O
from O
the O
beginning O
is O
that O
China B-LOC
is O
never O
as O
lucrative O
as O
it O
looks O
. O

This O
assumption O
is O
based O
on O
about O
150 O
years O
of O
economic O
history O
, O
including O
several O
booms O
in O
interest O
and O
investment O
in O
China B-LOC
. O

Their O
biggest O
problem O
: O
There O
's O
usually O
a O
200-to-1 O
ratio O
of O
Nearly O
Starving O
Peasant O
Laborers O
to O
Absurdly O
Well-Off O
Government O
Employees O
. O

And O
now O
it's O
an O
iffier O
100-to-1 O
, O
since O
there O
are O
also O
rich O
private O
sector O
employees O
and O
the O
labor O
force O
is O
n't O
quite O
so O
expendable O
. O

What O
they O
've O
been O
missing O
for O
years O
was O
the O
real O
driver O
behind O
any O
consumer O
economy O
: O
Consumers O
. O

Specifically O
, O
they O
did O
n't O
have O
a O
real O
middle O
class O
. O

That O
's O
changed O
in O
the O
last O
twenty O
years O
, O
as O
increasing O
social O
mobility O
and O
a O
burst O
in O
foreign O
demand O
has O
finally O
made O
China B-LOC
a O
genuine O
, O
rather O
than O
theoretical O
, O
contender O
. O

And O
they O
've O
even O
supplied O
proof O
of O
their O
economic O
viability O
, O
announcing O
that O
they O
've O
beaten O
Japan B-LOC
for O
exports O
to O
the O
US B-LOC
. O

If O
only O
I O
'd O
figured O
this O
out O
in O
early O
2002 O
, O
when O
their O

Commissioner O

John O

claims O
that O
Marsh B-ORG
'got O
off O
the O
hook O
' O
-- O
and O
you O
can O
bet O
he O
's O
got O
a O
plan O
to O
fix O
that O
. O

Perhaps O
the O
worst O
feature O
of O
Spitzer O
's O
Attila O
the O
Hun-like O
sweep O
through O
the O
financial O
services O
industry O
is O
his O
habit O
of O
breeding O
imitators O
, O
who O
will O
essentially O
use O
his O
settlement O
as O
a O
benchmark O
for O
creating O
their O
own O
demands O
. O

Interestingly O
enough O
, O
this O
morning O
's O
Wall B-ORG
Street O
Journal B-ORG
reported O
that O
Marsh B-ORG
paid O
a O
higher O
fee O
than O
they O
needed O
to O
-- O
that O
the O
$ O
850 O
million O
number O
was O
agreed O
upon O
at O
the O
last O
minute O
mainly O
so O
Marsh B-ORG
could O
pay O
out O
over O
a O
four-year O
period O
without O
admitting O
guilt O
. O

The O
rhetoric O
we O
're O
hearing O
-- O
that O
Marsh B-ORG
may O
have O
cost O
customers O
billions O
of O
dollars O
-- O
does O
n't O
match O
the O
reality O
that O
in O
a O
few O
cases O
, O
they O
manipulated O
bids O
, O
but O
that O
the O
proven O
damages O
thus O
far O
involve O
only O
a O
few O
million O
dollars O
of O
business O
priced O
5 O
% O
or O
10 O
% O
higher O
than O
it O
otherwise O
would O
have O
been O

It O

: O
The O

at O

astounding O
rate O

Usually O

the O

auto O

works O

Anyway O
, O
a O
few O
announcements O
during O
the O
last O
two O
days O
underscore O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
growth O
in O
memory O
and O
processing O
power O
for O
computers O
is O
far O
from O
over O
: O
Hewlett-Packard B-ORG
is O
developing O
a O
new O
replacement O
for O
the O
transistor O
, O
and O
a O
consortium O
of O
software O
companies O
is O
backing O
a O
new O
technology O
that O
would O
allow O
discs O
to O
hold O
up O
to O
a O
terabyte O
of O
information O
. O

No O
idea O
where O
this O
will O
end O
up O
: O
It O
's O
not O
altogether O
rare O
that O
these O
announcements O
result O
in O
a O
very O
expensive O
project O
to O
develop O
something O
that O
, O
for O
whatever O
reason O
, O
is O
n't O
worthwhile O
to O

. O

But O
it O
's O
important O
to O
remember O
that O
the O
status O
quo O
is O
never O
more O
than O
a O
snapshot O

Byrne O
According O
to O
the O
usually O
reliable O
CNN/Money B-ORG
, O
the O
`` O
Twin O
Deficits O
'' O
will O
continue O
to O
grow O
. O

Interesting O
terminology O
... O

I O
believe O
they're O
referring O
to O
the O
budget O
deficit O
and O
... O
the O
capital O
surplus O
? O

When O
analyzing O
trade O
deficits O
, O
it O
's O
important O
to O
realize O
that O
the O
amount O
by O
which O
imports O
exceed O
exports O
is O
also O
equal O
to O
the O
net O
amount O
foreign O
investors O
have O
bet O
on O
the O
US B-LOC
. O

So O
the O
trade O
deficit O
is O
due O
to O
a O
confluence O
of O
the O
pressures O
from O
US B-LOC
consumers O
( O
who O
control O
about O
20 O
% O
of O
global O
GDP O
) O
and O
everybody O
else O
( O
excluding O
the O
non-consumption O
share O
of O
US B-LOC
GDP O
, O
that O
would O
amount O
to O
around O
75 O
% O
of O
global O
GDP O
) O
. O

Which O
of O
those O
is O
-- O
probably O
-- O
going O
to O
be O
a O
more O
important O
number O
? O

Even O
if O
we O
are O
consumers O
bent O
on O
gorging O
ourselves O
with O
imported O
goods O
, O
the O
largest O
pressure O
on O
the O
deficit O
is O
that O
we O
're O
simply O
a O
better O
place O
for O
investment O
-- O
higher O
returns O
on O
capital O
in O
developing O
countries O
are O
more O
than O
mitigated O
by O
the O
higher O
political O
risks O
they O
face O
. O

And O
what O
about O
that O
other O
deficit O
? O

It O
, O
of O
course O
, O
is O
the O
ominous O
sum O
that O
we O
fund O
without O
taxes O
, O
but O
by O
borrowing O
funds O
. O

And O
about O
half O
of O
those O
borrowings O
end O
up O
with O
the O
major O
banks O
in O
Asia B-LOC
. O

So O
, O
not O
to O
be O
a O
heretic O
, O
but O
1 O
) O
We O
're O
issuing O
them O
at O
relatively O
low O
interest O
rates O
, O
2 O
) O
Inflation O
is O
bound O
to O
pick O
up O
eventually O
, O
and O
so O
3 O
) O
Would O
n't O
you O
rather O
have O
our O
deficits O
made O
up O
by O
economically O
nonsensical O
purchases O
by O
non-US B-LOC
investors O
, O
rather O
than O
raising O
taxes O
in O
America B-LOC
? O

It O
's O
a O
question O
of O
who O
will O
pay O
for O
the O
same O
spending O
, O
and O
all O
else O
being O
equal O
I O
'd O
be O
happy O
for O
Asian B-LOC
central O
banks O
to O
pick O
up O
the O
tab O
. O

The O
Twin O
Deficits O
are O
a O
reality O
, O
but O
they O
are O
n't O
exactly O
a O
terrifying O
one O

The O

clearly O
enthusiastic O
about O

Let O

be O

There O
are O
few O
worse O
times O
to O

than O
when O
the O

it O

pretty O

What O
's O
notable O
in O
this O
debate O
, O
however O
, O
is O
that O
according O
to O
MSN B-ORG
Moneycentral I-ORG
, O
tobacco O
executives O
are O
attacking O
the O
tax O
by O
noting O
that O
`` O
While O
North B-LOC

excise O
tax O
is O
only O
5 O
cents O
, O
the O
total O

given O
to O

by O
smokers O
adds O
up O
to O
more O
than O
61 O
cents O
per O

. O
'' O

Okay O
, O
okay O
-- O
since O
the O
tobacco O
companies O
pay O
lots O
of O
money O
to O
the O
states O
, O
that O
's O
technically O
accurate O
. O

But O
the O
point O
of O
these O
taxes O
is O
to O
align O
the O
price O
of O
a O
pack O
with O
the O
cost O
to O
society O
, O
and O
inasmuch O
as O
these O
penalties O
are O
n't O
assessed O
on O
a O
per-pack O
basis O
, O
they O
do O
n't O
-- O
they O
're O
a O
lump-sum O
reflection O
of O
the O
taxes O
these O
companies O
ought O
to O
have O
paid O
before O
. O

Interestingly O
, O
the O
policy O
of O
making O
cigarette O
buyers O
pay O
to O
compensate O
society O
for O
the O
costs O
they O
impose O
is O
a O
politically O
palatable O
synthesis O
of O
the O
unpalatable O
notion O
of O
simply O
refusing O
treatment O
unless O
they O
pay O
full O
cost O
. O

They O
're O
basically O
buying O
future O
medical O

their O
lives O
, O
rather O
than O
eventually O
making O
the O

he O

But O
the O
whole O

to O
outsmart O
an O

that O

the O

In O
this O
case O

the O
most O

that O

that O

The O
change O

A O
little O

choose O

it O

Maurice O
R. O
`` O

Greenberg O
, O
who O
turns O
80 O

groomed O
two O

both O
have O
since O

then O
created O

2002 O
, O
which O
includes O
co-COOs O
Martin O
J. O
Sullivan O
and O
Donald O
P. O
Kanak O

Both O
are O
considered O
possible O
successors O

but O
the O
board O
wo O
n't O
know O
Greenberg's O
preference O
until O
his O
departure O
, O
when O
it O
opens O
a O
sealed O
letter O
. O

Perhaps O
this O
is O
a O
good O
time O
for O
a O
quick O
refresher O
... O
. O

The O
CEO O
works O
for O
the O
board O
... O
end O
lesson O
. O

I O
guess O
it O
is O
not O
as O
straight O
forward O
when O
your O
CEO O
is O
also O
chairman O
and O
one O
of O
the O
largest O
shareholders O
. O

It O
would O
be O
tempting O
to O
get O
on O
my O
high O
horse O
right O
now O
about O
the O
need O
to O
separate O
the O
positions O
of O
CEO O
and O
Chairman O
but O
to O
be O
honest O
with O
you O
I O
do O
n't O
really O
believe O
that O
. O

I O
know O
CEO/chair O
duality O
is O
a O
popular O
cause O
for O
corporate O
governance O
. O

However O
there O
is O
little O
empirical O
evidence O
to O
suggest O
that O
separating O
these O
roles O
affects O
firm O
performance O
in O
either O
a O
positive O
or O
negative O
way O
. O

Having O
a O
combined O
CEO/Chairman O
does O
reduce O
the O
ability O
of O
the O
board O
to O
act O
as O
a O
check O
on O
management O
and O
this O
does O
mean O
that O
you O
need O
to O
be O
more O
critical O
in O
your O
assessment O
of O
the O
trustworthiness O
of O
the O
top O
management O
team O
. O

This O
downside O
of O
having O
a O
combined O
CEO/chair O
is O
offset O
by O
( O
1 O
) O
a O
reduction O
of O
coordination O
and O
communication O
costs O
at O
the O
top O
of O
the O
organization O
and O
( O
2 O
) O
an O
increase O
in O
the O
negotiating O
position O
of O
the O
CEO O
when O
dealing O
with O
suppliers O
, O
potential O
merger O
partners O
, O

could O
be O
particularly O
useful O
in O

industry O

I O
do O
however O
look O
more O
carefully O
at O
the O
top O
management O
team O
of O
a O

with O
a O
CEO/Chair O
before O

It O
is O
important O
that O
you O
can O
get O
a O
sense O
of O
the O
trustworthiness O
of O
the O

Is O
there O
high O
turnover O
among O

Is O
there O
a O
record O

If O
the O

I O
also O
look O
at O
the O
performance O
of O
the O

I O

John O
A O
It O
is O
just O
about O
time O
for O
Fortune B-ORG
magazine I-ORG
to O
release O
its O
2005 O
list O
of O
100 O
Best O
Companies O
to O
Work O
For O
. O

So O
now O
is O
a O
good O
time O
to O
ask O
a O
simple O
question O
: O
Why O
should O
we O
care O
? O

Making O
this O
list O
is O
certainly O
a O
source O
of O
pride O
. O

It O
can O
also O
be O
helpful O
if O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
nice O
new O
job O
. O

Should O
anyone O
else O
pay O
attention O
to O
this O
list O
? O

Well O
, O
thanks O
for O
asking O
because O
I O
just O
happen O
to O
have O
an O
answer O
for O
that O
question O
. O

It O
turns O
out O
that O
investors O
can O
benefit O
by O
paying O
attention O
to O
this O
list O
as O
well O
. O

In O
a O
study O
published O
in O
the O
Journal B-ORG
of O
Business O
Finance O
& O
amp O
; O
Accounting B-ORG
( O
2003 O
, O
30:771-798 O
) O
, O
Greg O
Filbeck O
and O
Dianna O
Preece O
found O
that O
companies O
on O
the O
Fortune B-ORG
list O
of O
100 O
Best O
Companies O
to O
Work O
For O
outperformed O
a O
matched O
sample O
of O
firms O
along O
multiple O
measures O
of O
return O
. O

This O
study O
is O
particularly O
relevant O
for O
investors O
because O
the O
authors O
measured O
return O
after O
the O
list O
was O
announced O
. O

To O
often O
these O
studies O
use O
as O
a O
starting O
point O
the O
moment O
before O
information O
becomes O
public O
. O

The O
only O
way O
to O
benefit O
from O
such O
information O
is O
by O
holding O
the O
stock O
before O
the O
information O
becomes O
public O
. O

This O
study O
indicates O
that O
the O
Best O
Companies O
to O
Work O
For O
information O
may O
still O
be O
useful O
even O
after O
the O
information O
becomes O
public O
. O

It O
might O
also O
be O
useful O
to O
look O
at O
companies O
that O
have O
consistently O
made O
the O
list O
in O
the O
previous O
few O
years O
and O
make O
an O
educated O
guess O
about O
their O
inclusion O
on O
this O
year O
's O
list O
. O

Search O
the O
news O
archives O
and O
see O
if O
in O
the O
past O
year O
the O
company O
did O
anything O
that O
might O
have O
totally O
pissed O
off O
their O
employees O
. O

Massive O
layoffs O
, O
bitter O
union O
battles O
, O
stopped O
offering O
free O
massages O
, O
etc O
. O

You O
might O
also O
want O
to O
be O
wary O
if O
the O
CEO O
or O
a O
bunch O
of O
other O
top O
executives O
have O
been O
replaced O
. O

That O
can O
often O
generate O
a O
period O
of O
uncertainty O
in O
a O
workforce O

I O
ca O
n't O
for O
the O
life O
of O
me O
figure O
out O
why O
anyone O
would O
invest O
in O
the O
airline O
industry O
. O

Please O
, O
someone O
tell O
me O
a O
group O
companies O
facing O
more O
serious O
problems O
than O
the O
legacy O

Delta B-ORG

US B-ORG

Continental B-ORG

American B-ORG

High O
fuel O

and O
a O
highly O
paid O

To O
this O
list O
of O
woes O
, O
we O
add O
a O
whole O
slew O
of O
competitors O
with O
much O
lower O
cost O
structures O
. O

I O
admit O
I O
've O
already O
taken O
advantage O
of O
the O
lower O
fares O
announced O
last O
week O
to O
book O
a O
business O
trip O
but O
these O
next O
few O
years O
are O
not O
going O
to O
be O
pretty O
for O
some O
of O
these O
companies O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
the O
pain O
is O
not O
limited O
to O
these O
companies O
. O

Pittsburgh B-LOC
, O
one O
of O
US B-ORG
Airway I-ORG
's O
hubs O
, O
built O
up O
its O
airport O
complete O
with O
a O
sprawling O
retail O
complex O
in O
the O
terminal O
. O

Now O
US B-ORG
Airways I-ORG
has O
reduced O
flights O
out O
of O
Pittsburgh B-LOC
by O
28 O
% O
since O
January O
of O
2004 O
and O
is O
in O
real O
danger O
of O
folding O
completely O
. O

These O
shiny O
new O
airports O
are O
usually O
financed O
by O
long-term O
bonds O
that O
still O
have O
to O
paid O
off O
... O
but O
not O
by O
the O
airlines O
. O

This O
is O
an O
industry O
looking O
for O
a O
sustainable O
strategy O
. O

Southwest B-ORG
and O
JetBlue B-ORG
were O
the O
only O
major O
airlines O
to O
earn O
a O
profit O
in O
2004 O
but O
who O
knows O
what O
will O
be O
happening O
in O
another O
five O
years O
. O

So O
I O
will O
thankfully O
accept O
the O
low O
fares O
, O
bemoan O
the O
loss O
of O
food O
on O
flights O
, O
and O
watch O
these O

out O

the O

both O
factor O
into O
my O
External O

As O
a O
rule O
, O
I O
am O
wary O
of O
companies O
that O
do O
either O
of O
these O
things O
until O
I O
am O
confident O
that O
they O
have O
changed O
their O
standard O

It O
may O
take O
a O

years O

and O
several O
more O
financial O

( O
on O
time O

course O
) O
, O
before O
I O
am O
persuaded O
to O
take O
a O
second O
look O
at O
the O
company O
. O

The O
bottom O
line O
is O
that O
I O
rely O
on O
SEC B-ORG
filings O
to O
assess O
companies O
and O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
have O
any O
doubt O
about O
the O
veracity O
of O
the O
information O
contained O
in O
these O

In O
Nortel B-ORG

defense O
, O
they O
have O
just O
gone O
through O
the O
perfect O
storm O
in O
the O
telecommunications O
equipment O
sector O
. O

The O
whole O
industry O
overbuilt O
and O
got O
blindsided O
by O
the O
tech O
downturn O
. O

This O
could O
be O
described O
as O
a O
growth O
industry O
that O
went O
on O
a O
bender O
and O
is O
now O
trying O
to O
recover O
from O
the O
hangover O
. O

I O
've O
always O
felt O
that O
you O
learn O
a O
lot O
about O
someone O
when O
you O
see O
how O
they O
try O
to O
recover O
from O
a O
hangover O
( O
pause O
for O

. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
time O
to O
assess O
organizational O
effectiveness O
in O
the O
telecommunications O

Nortel B-ORG

I O

) O

and O
hope O
for O
an O
uptick O
in O
demand O
before O
they O
would O
have O
to O
come O
clean O
. O

Both O
companies O
have O
been O
penalized O
for O
these O
actions O
and O
have O
continued O
to O
restructure O
operations O
, O
sell O
assets O
, O
and O
layoff O

Cisco B-ORG
, O
on O
the O
other O

, O
was O
able O
to O
take O
one O
huge O
restructuring O
charge O
in O
2001 O
and O
move O
forward O
. O

Their O
ability O
to O
do O
this O
and O
have O
it O
work O
( O
so O
far O
) O
indicates O
a O
very O
deep O
and O
impressive O
understanding O
of O
their O
organization O

Especially O
when O
compared O
to O
its O
competitors O
, O
Cisco B-ORG
seems O
to O
be O
back O

Corporate O

Just O
saying O

to O

some O
fairly O

The O

that O

the O

contain O
valuable O

you O
've O
probably O
heard O
the O
standard O
answer O

the O
evidence O
is O
mixed O
. O

That O
is O
true O
but O
not O
very O
revealing O
would O
n't O
you O
say O
? O

Evidence O
is O
mixed O
mostly O
because O
( O
1 O
) O
there O
is O
little O
agreement O
about O
how O
to O
measure O
social O
responsibility O
and O
( O
2 O
) O
many O
current O
measures O
toss O
together O
a O
heap O
of O
information O
that O
has O
no O
business O
being O
lumped O
together O
. O

Social O
responsibility O
often O
includes O
everything O
from O
treatment O
of O
employees O
to O
type O
of O
product O
produced O
. O

There O
is O
not O
really O
any O
reason O
to O
believe O
that O
selling O
guns O
or O
tobacco O
has O
anything O
to O
do O
with O
forcing O
employees O
to O
work O
unpaid O
overtime O
. O

Yet O
both O
get O
lumped O
together O
in O
the O
socially O
responsible O
investing O
discussion O
. O

Once O
you O
start O
to O
break O
apart O
social O
responsibility O
into O
its O
various O
components O
, O
you O
start O
to O
see O
the O
valuable O
information O
. O

Companies O
that O
have O
poor O
employee O

tend O
to O
underperform O
, O
as O
do O
companies O
that O
pollute O
at O
a O
higher O
rate O
than O
their O
industry O
peers O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
companies O
with O
numerous O
NLRB B-ORG
violations O
do O
n't O
do O
worse O
than O
their O
peers O

companies O
that O
sell O
your O
typical O
`` O
sin O
'' O
products O
( O
tobacco O
, O
firearms O
, O

) O
can O
be O
excellent O

for O

Seattle B-LOC

Amazon B-ORG
ended O
the O
day O
down O
14.6 O
% O

Starbucks B-ORG
down O
8.2 O
% O

I O
should O
disclose O
that O
I O
spent O
a O
few O
years O
living O
in O
Seattle B-LOC
and O
I O
have O
a O
soft O
spot O
in O
my O
heart O
for O
all O
things O
Seattle B-LOC
. O

As O
far O
as O
I O
could O
tell O
, O
many O
people O
in O
the O
Northwest O
spend O
the O
mornings O
drinking O
lattes O
and O
their O
evenings O
drinking O
microbrews O

Really O
not O
a O
bad O
lifestyle O
. O

Anyway O
, O
back O
on O
topic O
here O
. O

Market O
over O
reaction O
? O

Hard O
to O
say O
. O

Both O
companies O
have O
pricey O
stocks O
and O
those O
valuations O
are O
based O
on O
optimistic O
expectations O
of O
future O
growth O
. O

Yesterday O
's O
news O
led O
many O
to O
question O
their O
growth O
assumptions O
for O
these O
companies O
. O

Today O
I O
want O
to O
talk O
a O
bit O
about O
Starbucks B-ORG
. O

I O
think O
I O
have O
to O
start O
by O
acknowledging O
that O
the O
stock O
is O
still O
pricey O
even O
after O
its O
drop O
yesterday O
. O

However O
, O
my O
organizational O
indicators O
analysis O
reveals O
a O
very O
low O
level O
of O
business O
risk O
. O

This O
may O
partially O
justify O
a O
higher O
P/E O
ratio O
. O

A O
couple O
weeks O
ago O
, O
I O
observed O
that O
Wal-Mart B-ORG
had O
offsetting O
strong O
and O
weak O
organizational O
indicators O
. O

Starbucks B-ORG
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
has O
uniformly O
strong O
organizational O
indicators O
. O

Starbucks B-ORG
scores O
as O
best O
in O
its O
industry O
on O
six O
of O
seven O
organizational O
indicators O
. O

Not O
surprising O
are O
its O
strong O
scores O
in O
the O
employee O
relations O
and O
stakeholder O
actions O
indicators O
. O

Its O
weakest O
score O
is O
in O
the O
external O
reporting O
indicator O
. O

In O
the O
past O
, O
several O
observers O
have O
raised O
concerns O
about O
aggressive O
accounting O
at O
Starbucks B-ORG
but O
my O
analysis O
does O
not O
indicate O
any O
systematic O
current O
issues O
. O

The O
weak O
score O
is O
primarily O
the O
result O
of O
Starbucks B-ORG
current O
strategy O
of O
increasing O
equity O
ownership O
of O
several O
foreign O
subsidiaries O
. O

This O
is O
a O
strategic O
shift O
that O
has O
short-term O
costs O
and O
adds O
some O
uncertainty O
to O
the O
financial O
statements O
. O

Beyond O
the O
strong O
Organizational O
Indicator O
analysis O
, O
several O
additional O
factors O
favor O
Starbucks B-ORG
ability O
to O
continue O
to O
grow O

Starbucks B-ORG
is O
not O
currently O
financing O
its O
growth O
with O
debt O
. O

Considering O
its O
growth O
, O
this O
is O
amazing O
. O

It O
also O
means O
that O
Starbucks B-ORG
has O
a O
large O
amount O
of O
flexibility O
in O
how O
it O
finances O
future O
growth O
. O

The O
company O
can O
assume O
much O
more O
debt O
without O
negatively O
affecting O
its O
risk O
profile O
because O
... O
2 O
. O

Starbucks B-ORG
has O
a O
healthy O
cashflow O
and O
current O
cash O
position O
. O

This O
allows O
the O
company O
to O
grow O
without O
debt O
. O

You O
could O
argue O
that O
Starbucks B-ORG
has O
too O
much O
cash O
and O
should O
do O
more O
to O
pass O
it O
on O
to O
shareholders O
. O

This O
option O
is O
another O
way O
that O
Starbucks B-ORG
has O
retained O
its O
flexibility O
for O

3 O
. O

Starbucks B-ORG
is O
the O
primary O
owner O
of O
its O
stores O
and O
limits O
franchising O
. O

While O
Starbucks B-ORG
does O
partner O
( O
airlines O
, O
airports O
, O
Barnes B-ORG
& O
amp O
; O
Noble B-ORG
) O
, O
most O
of O
its O
stores O
are O
company O
owned O
. O

From O
a O
managerial O
perspective O
this O
greatly O
simplifies O
cost O
structures O
, O
product O
changes O
, O
and O
quality O
control O
. O

Taken O
together O
all O
of O
these O
factors O
paint O
a O
picture O
of O
a O
company O
with O
a O
very O
strong O
future O
. O

I O
can O
not O
say O
if O
these O
factors O
justify O
the O
current O
share O
price O
but O
I O
would O
say O
that O
they O
justify O
a O
higher O
P/E O
ratio O
than O
the O
industry O
norm O
. O

Risk O
is O
lower O

Interesting O
aside O
: O
Starbucks B-ORG
is O
taking O
over O
the O
location O
in O
my O
town O
that O
was O
recently O
abandoned O
by O
Krispy B-ORG
Kreme I-ORG

Disclosure O
: O
At O
the O
time O
of O
this O
writing O
I O
do O
not O
own O
Starbucks B-ORG
stock O

but O
I O
am O
tempted O
and O
might O
consider O
a O
buy O
next O
week O

I O
am O
also O
tempted O
to O
go O
buy O
a O
