WOODRUFF O
That O
report O
filed O
just O
a O
short O
time O
ago O
. O

Well O
, O
CNN B-ORG
analyst O
Ken O
Pollack O
who O
is O
with O
the O
Center B-ORG
for O
Middle O
East O
Policy B-ORG
at O
the O
Brookings B-ORG
Institution I-ORG
is O
with O
me O
now O
. O

He O
is O
an O
expert O
on O
the O
Iraqi B-LOC
military O
and O
its O
tactics O
and O
weapons O
. O

Ken O
Pollack O
, O
that O
resistance O
that O
we O
just O
saw O
the O
British B-LOC
troops O
dealing O
with O
, O
you O
and O
I O
were O
talking O
earlier O
today O
. O

The O
story O
the O
last O
few O
days O
has O
been O
the O
surprising O
level O
of O
resistance O
but O
you O
're O
telling O
me O
your O
sense O
is O
that O
the O
coalition B-LOC
forces O
are O
beginning O
to O
adjust O
to O
that O
. O

KEN O
POLLACK O
, O
CENTER O
FOR O
MIDDLE O
EAST O
POLICY O
, O
BROOKINGS O
INSTITUTION O
Right O
. O

I O
mean O
we O
're O
seeing O
one O
of O
the O
great O
advantages O
of O
U.S B-LOC
. O

and O
British B-LOC
forces O
now O
, O
Judy O
, O
which O
is O
that O
they O
're O
superbly O
trained O
troops O
. O

They O
have O
training O
in O
a O
whole O
variety O
of O
different O
missions O
and O
they're O
adapting O
. O

They O
recognize O
now O
they O
went O
in O
with O
some O
false O
assumptions O
about O
the O
kind O
of O
reception O
that O
they O
were O
going O
to O
face O
. O

The O
plan O
that O
was O
implemented O
had O
some O
inherent O
risks O
in O
it O
, O
risks O
to O
the O
supply O
line O
, O
risks O
in O
terms O
of O
not O
clearing O
cities O
and O
they O
're O
shifting O
. O

They're O
changing O
and O
the O
troops O
are O
trained O
well O
enough O
to O
be O
able O
to O
deal O
with O
that O
. O

You O
've O
seen O
U.S B-LOC
. O

Central B-ORG
Command I-ORG
bringing O
up O
additional O
forces O
like O
the O
82nd B-ORG
Airborne O
Division B-ORG
to O
better O
deal O
with O
these O
long O
supply O
lines O
, O
get O
control O
over O
the O
cities O
and O
so O
I O
think O
that O
U.S B-LOC
. O

and O
British B-LOC
forces O
are O
beginning O
to O
stabilize O
the O
battlefield O
. O

WOODRUFF O
So O
as O
an O
onlooker O
, O
as O
somebody O
who O
's O
studied O
the O
Iraqi B-LOC
capabilities O
, O
is O
it O
your O
sense O
that O
the O
coalition O
can O
continue O
to O
adjust O
to O
whatever O
they O
deal O
with O
? O

POLLACK O
Absolutely O
. O

One O
of O
the O
things O
I O
think O
we O
're O
likely O
to O
see O
is O
that O
the O
Iraqis O
are O
going O
to O
have O
a O
tougher O
time O
adapting O
than O
U.S B-LOC
. O

forces O
are O
. O

Typically O
what O
you O
've O
seen O
in O
the O
Iraqi B-LOC
armed O
forces O
is O
the O
change O
has O
to O
come O
from O
the O
top O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
come O
from O
the O
ground O
up O
. O

You O
do O
n't O
have O
ground O
commanders O
calling O
back O
and O
saying O
hey O
, O
we O
'd O
like O
to O
try O
this O
tactic O
or O
this O
seems O
to O
work O
. O

Tell O
everybody O
else O
to O
do O
the O
same O
thing O
. O

Instead O
the O
high O
command O
has O
to O
identify O
a O
problem O
, O
come O
up O
with O
a O
solution O
and O
transmit O
it O
down O
. O

Chances O
are O
the O
Iraqis O
are O
going O
to O
continue O
to O
stick O
with O
what O
we O
've O
seen O
before O
, O
irregular O
forces O
blending O
in O
with O
civilians O
trying O
to O
attack O
U.S B-LOC
. O

forces O
, O
some O
more O
of O
these O
suicide O
attacks O
which O
are O
going O
to O
be O
problematic O
for O
our O
troops O
. O

There's O
no O
way O
around O
that O
but O
U.S B-LOC
. O

forces O
, O
British B-LOC
forces O
are O
beginning O
to O
adapt O
to O
it O
. O

WOODRUFF O
I O
want O
to O
ask O
you O
about O
you O
mentioned O
coalition O
forces O
going O
in O
expecting O
more O
support O
from O
ordinary O
Iraqi B-LOC
people O
. O

I O
just O
interviewed O
a O
gentleman O
, O
native O
of O
Iraq B-LOC
, O
who O
talks O
to O
his O
family O
there O
all O
the O
time O
and O
he O
says O
they O
live O
in O
Baghdad B-LOC
20 O
, O
30 O
, O
50 O
of O
them O
and O
he O
said O
they O
do O
the O
view O
the O
Americans O
as O
invaders O
. O

They O
hate O
Saddam O
Hussein O
. O

They O
do O
n't O
like O
what O
he O
's O
doing O
but O
they O
do O
n't O
think O
the O
Americans O
are O
the O
answer O
. O

POLLACK O
All O
right O
. O

Well O
, O
this O
is O
something O
that O
we O
've O
been O
trying O
to O
get O
a O
grip O
on O
for O
years O
, O
exactly O
what O
the O
Iraqi B-LOC
people O
feel O
and O
also O
that O
I O
think O
the O
best O
evidence O
that O
we O
had O
before O
the O
attack O
began O
was O
that O
Iraqis O
do O
, O
they O
despise O
. O

They O
are O
desperate O
to O
be O
rid O
of O
him O
but O
by O
the O
same O
token O
, O
they O
do O
n't O
like O
another O
country O
coming O
into O
their O
country O
to O
overturn O
the O
government O
and O
beyond O
that O
, O
I O
think O
it O
's O
probably O
most O
important O
for O
most O
Iraqis O
is O
they O
're O
deeply O
suspicious O
of O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
. O

They O
remember O
that O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
betrayed O
them O
in O
1991 O
. O

The O
U.S B-LOC
. O

did O
n't O
finish O
Saddam O
then O
. O

President O
Bush O
- O
then O
President O
Bush O
called O
on O
them O
to O
rise O
up O
and O
then O
the O
U.S B-LOC
. O

did O
nothing O
and O
so O
they O
're O
deeply O
suspicious O
of O
what O
we O
have O
in O
mind O
. O

WOODRUFF O
Which O
raises O
questions O
going O
forward O
. O

One O
last O
thing O
, O
Ken O
Pollack O
I O
want O
to O
ask O
about O
this O
British B-LOC
officials O
saying O
that O
they O
have O
information O
that O
Saddam O
Hussein O
has O
fired O
his O
air O
defense O
chief O
. O

What O
's O
the O
significance O
of O
that O
? O

POLLACK O
Well O
, O
if O
it O
's O
true O
and O
obviously O
we O
do O
n't O
know O
just O
yet O
but O
if O
it O
's O
true O
, O
it O
is O
very O
significant O
because O
it O
's O
effectively O
the O
Iraqis O
admitting O
that O
many O
of O
the O
civilian O
casualties O
that O
we O
've O
seen O
over O
the O
last O
few O
days O
may O
in O
fact O
have O
been O
caused O
by O
Iraqi B-LOC
surface O
to O
air O
missiles O
falling O
back O
to O
ground O
in O
residential O
areas O
. O

WOODRUFF O
( O
INAUDIBLE O
) O
POLLACK O
Exactly O
, O
in O
that O
market O
and O
I O
think O
it O
was O
pretty O
apparent O
when O
you O
looked O
at O
the O
video O
of O
that O
market O
, O
if O
that O
had O
been O
a O
U.S B-LOC
. O

bomb O
or O
a O
U.S B-LOC
. O

cruise O
missile O
, O
that O
market O
would O
have O
been O
obliterated O
. O

Chances O
are O
it O
was O
an O

surface O
to O

B O
stupid O
how O

A O
Right O
. O

B O
You O
know O

because O
I O

by O

they O
get O

it O
really O
does O
n't O
really O

who O

they O

I O
do O

I O
w- O
I O

was O

You O
're O

a O

a O
pretty O

kind O

guy O
, O
are O
n't O
you O

A O
Well O
, O
I O
was O
the O
one O
, O
who O
just O
happened O
to O
go O
home O
back O
in O
like O
nineteen O
eighty O
or O
something O
and O
saw O
Bill O
Clinton O
B O
Oh O
, O
yeah O
? O

A O
on O
on O
television O
. O

He O
-- O
we O
ha- O
-- O
I O
came O
from O
a O
small O
town O
in O
Tennessee B-LOC
called O
Paris O
, O
and O
there O
's O
two O
stations O
we O
can O
pick O
up O
, O
one O
B O
Okay O
. O

A O
from O
Jackson B-LOC
, O
a O
little O
town O
, O
and O
the O
other O
was O
from O
Nashville B-LOC
, O
a O
big O
town O
. O

So O
we O
got O
most O
of O
our O
~TV O
from O
Jackson B-LOC
, O
so O
I O
was O
flipping O
through O
the O
channels O
, O
and O
I O
saw O
this O
little O
guy O
, O
uh O
the O
governor O
of O
Arkansas B-LOC
giving O
a O
speech O
. O

B O
Yep O
. O

A O
I O
said O
, O
that O
guy O
could O
be O
President O
. O

B O
Is O
that O
right O
? O

A O
I O
only O
heard O
about O
-- O
two O
minutes O
of O
him O
speaking O
. O

You O
know O
, O
he O
was O
articulate O
, O
he O
was O
charming O
, O
he O
was O
young O
. O

And O
I O
said O
, O
that O
guy O
could O
be O
president O
. O

B O
Yep O
. O

Yep O
. O

A O
And O
um O
so O
then O
when O
I O
heard O
he O
was O
running O
, O
those O
four O
years O
later O
-- O
uh O
, O
eight O
years O
later O
, O
whatever O
it O
was O
. O

Because O
it O
was O
a O
long O
time O
later O
. O

B O
Sure O
. O

A O
I O
saw O
him O
, O
and O
I O
was O
telling O
all O
my O
friends O
, O
oh O
, O
vote O
for O
vote O
for O
this O
guy O
, O
Bill O
Clinton O
, O
vote O
for O
him O
. O

They O
were O
saying O
, O
oh O
no O
, O
no O
, O
that O
old O
country O
-- O
dump O
. O

He O
do O
n't O
know O
nothing O
. O

I O
said O
, O
he O
's O
a O
Rhodes O
scholar O
, O
he O
's O
smart O
. O

He O
's O
and O
he O
's O
funny O
and O
he O
's O
good O
. O

Oh O
no O
, O
no O
, O
he O
's O
too O
young O
, O
and O
he O
came O
from O
that O
little O
, O
little O
podunk O
-- O
g- O
uh O
state O
he O
never O
did O
anything O
. O

I O
said O
, O
he O
's O
going O
to O
be O
President O
. O

I O
was O
telling O
all O
my O
friends O
. O

I O
said O
, O
you O
know O
, O
and O
I O
was O
before O
-- O
they O
said O
, O
well O
, O
I O
thought O
you O
supported O
George O
Bush O
, O
and O
I O
said O
, O
well O
I O
did O
support O
George O
Bush O
, O
but O
he O
does O
n't O
know O
what O
he O
's O
doing O
and O
he O
needs O
to O
go O
. O

And O
uh O
so O
I O
says O
vote O
for O
him O
, O
vote O
for O
him O
, O
vote O
for O
him O
, O
you O
know O
. O

And O
they O
voted O
for O
Jerry O
Brown O
and O
all O
these O
crazy O
people O
. O

B O
Yeah O
, O
that O
's O
right O
. O

Oh O
, O
is O
that O
right O
? O

A O
And O
I O
says O
, O
you O
're O
just O
wasting O
your O
vote O
, O
why O
are O
you O
doing O
that O
? O

He O
needs O
your O
help O
. O

So O
I O
went O
and O
volunteered O
for O
him O
and O
everything O
, O
and O
-- O
and O
I O
met O
Hillary O
, O
and O
and O
Tipper O
and O
Al O
, O
and O
and O
I O
almost O
got O
to O
meet O
him O
. O

B O
Oh O
, O
is O
that O
right O
? O

Really O
? O

A O
Uh-huh O
. O

I O
worked O
at O
the O
Democrats O
Convention O
and O
everything O
. O

Uh-huh O
, O
yeah O
. O

B O
Very O
cool O
, O
very O
cool O
. O

A O
And O
uh O
it O
was O
great O
, O
I O
had O
a O
good O
time O
, O
and O
they O
B O
What O
great O
experience O
. O

A O
Yeah O
, O
and O
they O
fed O
us O
, O
and O
had O
a O
party O
for O
us O
, O
all O
that O
kind O
of O
stuff O
, O
you O
know O
. O

So O
it O
was O
fun O
. O

But O
it O
worked O
out O
. O

But O
I O
think O
we O
they O
better O
go O
back O
to O
a O

from O
like O
uh O
B O
Well O
, O
sure O
. O

A O
uh O
North B-LOC
Carolina I-LOC
, O
or O
like O
the O
one O
from O
Kansas B-LOC
. O

She O

very O

, O
she O
reminds O
you O
of O
uh O
Christie O
Whitman O
, O
the O

New B-LOC

, O
remember O
her O

B O

Okay O

not O
not O

Eh O

A O

I O

she O
she O
can O

that O
people O
like O
in O

, O
of O
being O
the O

B O
Well O
, O
people O
want O
to O
feel O
secure O
, O
right O
? O

And O
who O
's O
in O
that O
position O
? O

They O
want O
to O
feel O
that O
they O
're O
trustworthy O
and O
honorable O
, O
and O
I O
think O
, O
you O
know O
A O
yeah O

Yeah O
, O
but O
B O
Clinton O
did O
so O
many O
fantastic O
things O
during O
his O
term O
in O
office O
, O
but O
he O
shot O
himself O
on O
the O
foot O
with O
all O
of O
his O
personal O
garbage O
, O
you O
know O
, O
and O
I O
think O
that O
overshadowed O
how O
brilliant O
he O
was O
as O

the O
car O
from O
the O
moment O
he O

put O
the O

If O

the O

in O
his O
possession O
then O
he O
's O
the O
person O
in O

The O
offence O
is O
being O
drunk O
in O
charge O
of O
a O
vehicle O
-- O
as O
distinct O
from O
being O
drunk O
while O
operating O
a O
vehicle O
( O
which O
is O
a O
separate O
offence O
) O
. O

The O
way O
to O
avoid O

is O
to O
give O
the O
keys O
to O
someone O
else O
to O
unlock O
the O
door O
and O
have O
them O
hang O
on O
to O
the O
keys O
until O
you O
're O

The O
standard O
ruse O
is O
to O
throw O
the O
keys O
under O
the O
car O
after O
you O
've O
unlocked O
the O
door O
( O
which O
you O
can O
later O
claim O
was O
unlocked O
by O
a O
person O
unknown O
) O
. O

In O
this O
case O
the O
offender O
escaped O
conviction O
first O
time O
around O
because O
it O
was O
accepted O
that O
he O
attempted O

get O
rid O

you O

it O
's O
illegal O
because O
when O
you O

we O

Byrne O
According O
to O
the O
usually O
reliable O
CNN/Money B-ORG
, O
the O
`` O
Twin O
Deficits O
'' O
will O
continue O
to O
grow O
. O

Interesting O
terminology O
... O

I O
believe O
they're O
referring O
to O
the O
budget O
deficit O
and O
... O
the O
capital O
surplus O
? O

When O
analyzing O
trade O
deficits O
, O
it O
's O
important O
to O
realize O
that O
the O
amount O
by O
which O
imports O
exceed O
exports O
is O
also O
equal O
to O
the O
net O
amount O
foreign O
investors O
have O
bet O
on O
the O
US B-LOC
. O

So O
the O
trade O
deficit O
is O
due O
to O
a O
confluence O
of O
the O
pressures O
from O
US B-LOC
consumers O
( O
who O
control O
about O
20 O
% O
of O
global O
GDP O
) O
and O
everybody O
else O
( O
excluding O
the O
non-consumption O
share O
of O
US B-LOC
GDP O
, O
that O
would O
amount O
to O
around O
75 O
% O
of O
global O
GDP O
) O
. O

Which O
of O
those O
is O
-- O
probably O
-- O
going O
to O
be O
a O
more O
important O
number O
? O

Even O
if O
we O
are O
consumers O
bent O
on O
gorging O
ourselves O
with O
imported O
goods O
, O
the O
largest O
pressure O
on O
the O
deficit O
is O
that O
we O
're O
simply O
a O
better O
place O
for O
investment O
-- O
higher O
returns O
on O
capital O
in O
developing O
countries O
are O
more O
than O
mitigated O
by O
the O
higher O
political O
risks O
they O
face O
. O

And O
what O
about O
that O
other O
deficit O
? O

It O
, O
of O
course O
, O
is O
the O
ominous O
sum O
that O
we O
fund O
without O
taxes O
, O
but O
by O
borrowing O
funds O
. O

And O
about O
half O
of O
those O
borrowings O
end O
up O
with O
the O
major O
banks O
in O
Asia B-LOC
. O

So O
, O
not O
to O
be O
a O
heretic O
, O
but O
1 O
) O
We O
're O
issuing O
them O
at O
relatively O
low O
interest O
rates O
, O
2 O
) O
Inflation O
is O
bound O
to O
pick O
up O
eventually O
, O
and O
so O
3 O
) O
Would O
n't O
you O
rather O
have O
our O
deficits O
made O
up O
by O
economically O
nonsensical O
purchases O
by O
non-US B-LOC
investors O
, O
rather O
than O
raising O
taxes O
in O
America B-LOC
? O

It O
's O
a O
question O
of O
who O
will O
pay O
for O
the O
same O
spending O
, O
and O
all O
else O
being O
equal O
I O
'd O
be O
happy O
for O
Asian B-LOC
central O
banks O
to O
pick O
up O
the O
tab O
. O

The O
Twin O

LUGAR O
Well O
, O
I O
was O
heartened O
by O
what O
Secretary O
Rumsfeld O
told O
you O
in O
the O
last O
interview O
, O
that O
we O
will O
have O
troops O
there O
as O
long O
as O
necessary O
, O
but O
no O
longer O
than O
necessary O
. O

I O
think O
that O
's O
a O
pretty O
good O
way O
to O
state O
it O
. O

My O
own O
view O
is O
that O
the O
security O
of O
the O
country O
clearly O
is O
our O
responsibility O
presently O
. O

We O
are O
trying O
to O
pass O
that O
on O
to O
others O
. O

Likewise O
, O
the O
other O
government O
's O
procedures O
, O
the O
fledgling O
beginnings O
on O
democracy O
, O
and O
all O
the O
rest O
. O

But O
that O
's O
going O
to O
require O
an O
undergirding O
. O

Now O
, O
in O
due O
course O
, O
as O
everybody O
points O
out O
, O
we O
may O
get O
help O
from O
other O
countries O
. O

We O
may O
bring O
in O
NATO B-ORG
allies O
or O
the O
United B-ORG
Nations I-ORG
or O
other O
people O
in O
the O
Arab O
world O
. O

That O
would O
be O
helpful O
. O

But O
for O
the O
moment O
, O
this O
is O
our O
responsibility O
. O

And O
we O
ought O
not O
to O
be O
having O
large O
debates O
about O
how O
rapidly O
we O
move O
out O
. O

And O
I O
was O
upset O
, O
in O
a O
way O
, O
to O
hear O
reports O
that O
by O
the O
fall O
, O
three O
divisions O
out O
of O
five O
would O
be O
gone O
. O

I O
think O
Secretary O
Rumsfeld O
disabused O
us O
of O
that O
today O
. O

BLITZER O
And O
what O
about O
you O
, O
Senator O
Dodd O
, O
not O
only O
the O
length O
of O
time O
, O
but O
the O
cost O
to O
U.S B-LOC
. O

taxpayers O
? O

Have O
you O
been O
given O
any O
ballpark O
estimate O
what O
this O
is O
going O
to O
cost O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
? O

DODD O
No O
. O

Well O
, O
what O
we O
've O
heard O
the O
numbers O
of O
reconstruction O
running O
around O
$ O
100 O
billion O
. O

We O
put O
$ O
2.5 O
billion O
in O
, O
in O
the O
last O
supplemental O
appropriations O
bill O
. O

So O
it O
's O
going O
to O
be O
costly O
. O

These O
RFPs O
, O
these O
seeking O
bids O
on O
various O
contracts O
are O
rather O
costly O
, O
and O
so O
it O
's O
going O
to O
be O
expensive O
. O

And O
clearly O
the O
responsibility O
is O
going O
to O
fall O
principally O
on O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
. O

Now O
, O
I O
would O
hope O
that O
sooner O
rather O
than O
later O
we O
could O
see O
a O
civilian O
government O
emerge O
in O
Iraq B-LOC

a O
democratically O
elected O
one O
, O
that O
there O
'd O
be O
more O
cooperation O
from O
the O

on O
both O
the O
peacekeeping O
side O
as O
well O
as O
the O
political O
restructuring O
that O

necessary O
in O
Iraq B-LOC

And O
to O
the O
extent O
we O
can O
move O

along O
more O
quickly O

I O

we O
're O
all O

a O
good O
thing O

about O
the O
elections O
that O
are O
going O

somebody O

the- O
A O
Um O
, O
Allan O
you O
got O
the O
same O
topic O
or- O
A O
yeah O
, O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
the O
same O
topic O
. O

So O
, O
huh O
. O

So O
, O
Allan O
Uh O
. O

A O

happen O
? O

Allan O
Sorry O
? O

A O
Do O
you O
think O
the O
elections O
are O
going O
to O
happen O
? O

Allan O
Yeah O
, O
I O
think O
the O
-- O
I O
think O
they O
're O
still O
they O
're O
going O
to O
go O
through O
even O
though O
, O
uh O
, O
even O
though O
, O
um O
, O
what O
's O
it O
called O
, O
that O
you O
know O
of O
all O
the O
-- O
turmoil O
that O
's O
happening O
there O
and O
all O
of O
the O
argu- O
you O
know O
, O
and O
all O
the O
-- O
killings O
and O
everything O
. O

I O
think O
it O
'll O
still O
go O
through O
, O
you O
know O
. O

The O
-- O
it O
's O
democracy O
, O
you O
know O
, O
you O
have O
to O
fight O
for O
it O
. O

It O
's O
not O
-- O
it O
does O
n't O
come O
easily O
, O
you O
know O
. O

A O
Right O
. O

Yeah O
, O
that O
's O
why O
I O
think O
it O
will O
, O
too O
, O
because O
they- O
they O
pushed O
it O
in O
Iraq B-LOC
. O

I O
mean O
, O
uh O
, O
excuse O
me O
, O
in O
Afghanistan B-LOC
. O

They O
kept O
on O
scheduling O
them O
and O
they O
we O
're O
saying O
, O
oh O
, O
no O
no O
no O
, O
you O
know O
. O

Allan O
Um O
, O
yeah O
, O
I O
think O
-- O
you O
know O
I O
think O
they O
should O
have O
continued O
to O
go O
through O
with O
it O
, O
and O
you O
know O
um O
-- O
if- O
if O
there O
is O
-- O
if O
there's O
problems O
, O
you O
know O
, O
just O
-- O
still O
-- O
do O
n't O
, O
you O
know O
-- O
just O
ignore O
it O
, O
keep O
going O
, O
you O
know O
you O
ca O
n't O
-- O
stop O
, O
you O
know O
, O
if O
you O
already O
started O
something O
, O
you O
know O
, O
you O
should O
complete O
it O
, O
I O
think O
. O

A O
Right O
. O

Allan O
I O
mean O
, O
if O
they O
leave O
-- O
if O
they O
leave O
, O
you O
know O
, O
if O
the- O
eh O
, O
let's O
say O
they O
, O
you O
know O
, O
they O
just O
leave O
right O
now O
, O
you O
know O
, O
the O
the O
-- O
they O
ca O
n't O
, O
you O
know O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
the O
-- O
the O
-- O
the O
occupants O
themselves O
regain O
control O
and O
, O
you O
know O
, O
and O
mo- O
and O
, O
you O
know O
, O
and O
-- O
put O
down O
the O
power O
and O
, O
you O
know O
, O
an- O
and O
control O
everything O
they O
can O
. O

They O
just O
need O
they O
, O
you O
know O
, O
they O
need O
assistance O
and O
to O
get O
off O
-- O
get O
off O
, O
you O
know O
, O
on O
the O
right O
step O
. O

I O
think O
they O
're O
going O
to O
need O
the O
military O
to O
be O
in O
there O
. O

And O
assist O
them O
with O
the O
elections O
and O
they O
need O
to O
complete O
the O
elections O
and O
all O
this O
. O

A O
Yeah O
, O
um O
, O
yeah O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
the O
end O
game O
, O
per O
se O
, O
is O
going O
to O
be O
there O
, O
you O
know O
, O
because O
, O
eh O
, O
they- O
the O
problem O
is O
the- O
is O
the O
culture O
, O
you O
know O
, O
it O
's O
-- O
pretty O
, O
uh O
, O
you O
know O
, O
it O
's O
really O
almost O
like O
a O
modern O
day O
Crusades O
, O
you O
know O
, O
and O
that's- O
that O
's O
kind O
of O
hard O
, O
you O
know O
. O

A O
lot O
of O
-- O
there O
's O
a O
lot O
of O
embitterment O
that O
goes O
back O
generations O
and O
stuff O
, O
so O
, O
you O
know O
, O
we O
have O
-- O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
I O
always O
think O
we O
have O
such O
a O
short O
mindset O
, O
uh O
, O
but O
they O
do O
n't O
. O

So O
, O
that O
's O
why O
, O
uh O
, O
I- O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
i- O
There O
's O
always O
going O
to O
be O
problems O
there O
, O
I O
just O
do O
n't O
-- O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
long O
we O
should O
-- O
be O
in O
Iraq B-LOC
. O

I O
mean O
, O
definitely O
to O
keep O
it O
stable O
. O

I- O
-- O
eh O
, O
I O
just O
-- O
I- O
I O
think O
the O
situation O
could O
be O
handled O
better O
. O

I- O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
a O
great O
idea O
fir- O
them O
going O
in O
there O
-- O
and O
doing O
what O
they O
did O
but O
, O
uh O
, O
they O
had O
a O
short O
window O
of O
opportunity O
to O
win O
over O
the O
people O
and O
it O
did O
n't O
happen O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
that O
was O
just O
out O
of O
our O
control O
or- O
or O
what O
or O
if O
we O
could O
've O
done O
a O
better O
job O
but O
, O
uh O
, O
you O
know O
. O

Allan O
Do O
you O
support O
the O
-- O
do O
you- O
do O
you O
support O
the O
war O
? O

A O
What O
's O
that O
now O
? O

Allan O
Do O
you O
support O
the O
war O
? O

A O
Yeah O
. O

Yeah O
, O
I O
did O
at O
first O
I O
just- O
I O
just O
-- O
I O
-- O
do O
n't O
like O
the O
way O
it O
was O
managed O
. O

I O
think O
-- O
I O
think O
, O
uh O
, O
they O
did O
a O
great O
job O
up O
front O
, O
of O
course O
. O

You O
know O
, O
they O
did O
militarily-wise O
, O
they O
did O
an O
excellent O
job O
but O
I O
think O
they O
've O
done O
a O
poor O
job O
, O
you O
know O
, O
reconstructing O
and O
just O
controlling O
the O
situation O
. O

You O
know O
, O
they- O
Allan O
Yeah O
, O
I- O
I O
agree O
also O
. O

Yeah O
, O
I- O
I O
mean O
, O
I- O
I O
did O
support O
the O
war O
. O

I O
just O
think O
that O
when O
they O
went O
in O
there O
, O
you O
know O
they O
-- O
they O
just O
did O
n't O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
they O
did O
n't O
i- O
execute O
everything O
correctly O
, O
you O
know O
there O
was O
problems O
, O
you O
know O
. O

A O
Yeah O
. O

Allan O
And O
I O
think O
I O
mean O
, O
that O
that O
lead O
to O
it O
, O
but O
yeah O
, O
I O
mean O
they O
-- O
I O
mean O
eh O
you O
know O
you O
're O
already O
in O
it O
, O
so O
you O
know O
, O
you O
should O
n't O
-- O
you O
ca O
n't O
just O
walk O
down O
and O
, O
you O
know O
, O
stop O
, O
you O
got O
to O
complete O
what O
you O
're O
doing O
, O
you O
know O
. O

So O
I O
A O
Right O
. O

Allan O
Yeah O
, O
um O
. O

A O
But O
, O
they- O
they O
definitely O
need O
to O
take O
a O
back O
seat O
to O
some O
sort O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
some O
sort O
of O
Iraqi B-LOC
government O
there O
. O

I O
know O
they O
set O
up O
the O
council O
, O
uh O
, O
interim O
council O
, O
but O
that O
has O
n't O
gone O
, O
you O
know O
, O
perfe- O
smoothly O
. O

Um O
, O
they O
still O
-- O
Americans O
have O
been O
calling O
the O
shots O
. O

So O
, O
if O
they O
can O
just O
sort O
of O
make O
a O
-- O
be- O
get O
into O
more O
of O
a O
supportive O
role O
and O
, O
you O
know O
, O
flex O
their O
muscles O
when O
they O
need O
to O
and O
maybe O
that O
will O
help- O
help O
, O
uh O
, O
squall O
some O
of O
the O
vi- O
the O
violence O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

Eh O
, O
if O
they O
could O
've O
-- O
if O
they O
could've O
shored O
up O
the O
borders O
, O
right O
after O
going O
in O
there O
, O
that O
would O
've O
been O
a O
-- O
that O
would O
've O
been O
a- O
a O
big O
plus O
, O
you O
know O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
that O
could O
, O
uh O
, O
if O
that O
's O
a O
-- O
plausible O
goal O
or O
not O
because O
, O
uh O
, O
it O
's O
just O
that- O
that O
-- O
a O
lot O
of O
that O
's O
, O
you O
know O
, O
uh O
, O

here O

, O
the O
Republican O
from O

NOVAK O
Congressman O
Sanders O
, O
you O
're O
opposed O
to O
this O
war O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
crazy O
about O
it O
myself O
. O

But O
I O
want O
to O
ask O
you O
a O
question O
. O

When O
the O
guns O
begin O
to O
fire O
, O
when O
the O
American B-LOC
men O
and O
women O
are O
in O
harm O

way O
and O
may O
be O
dying O
, O
is O
that O
now O
the O
time O
for O
you O
and O
your O
allies O
to O
shut O
up O

support O
the O

? O

( O
APPLAUSE O
) O
SANDERS O
Well O
it O
's O
not O
-- O
are O
you O
suggesting O
that O
when O
tens O
and O
thousands O
of O
Iraqi B-LOC
women O
and O
children O
are O
killed O
, O
and O
when O
young O
men O
and O
women O
in O
this O
country O
are O
unnecessarily O
put O
at O
harm O
's O
risk O
, O
what O
should O
we O
do O
? O

The O
answer O
is O
, O
these O
are O
my O
neighbors O
from O
Vermont B-LOC
and O
obviously O
we O
're O
going O
to O
support O
them O
. O

And O
obviously O
we O
're O
going O
to O
pray O
that O
there O
's O
fewer O
casualties O
... O
NOVAK O
Are O
you O
going O
to O
demonstrate O
against O
them O
in O

streets O
? O

SANDERS O
No O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
demonstrate O
against O
anybody O
during O
a O
war O
. O

But O
let O
's O
be O
clear O
. O

The O
president O
almost O
unilaterally O
is O
putting O
us O
in O
this O
position O
against O
world O
opinion O
. O

NOVAK O
Did O
n't O
the O
Congress B-ORG
support O
it O
? O

I O
thought O
you O
voted O
for O
it O
. O

SANDERS O
I O
did O
not O
vote O
for O
it O
. O

NOVAK O
I O
mean O
the O
Congress B-ORG
. O

The O
majority O
rules O
. O

SANDERS O
Yes O
. O

The O
Congress B-ORG
gave O
him O
authority O

but O
the O
American B-LOC
people O
disagreed O
with O
the O
decision O

NOVAK O

according O

BEGALA O
Congressman O
Hayworth O
, O
back O
to O
a O
comment O

And O
I O
know O
that O
you O
meant O
it O
and O
I O
agreed O
with O
it O
. O

You O
said O
, O
`` O
This O
is O
Saddam O
Hussein O
, O
the O
butcher O
of O
Baghdad B-LOC
. O
'' O

I O
'm O
curious O
, O
would O
that O
have O
accurately O
described O
him O
in O
1988 O
? O

HAYWORTH O
Oh O
, O
yes O
. O

I O
think O
it O
does O
. O

I O
think O
it O
has O
described O
him O
, O
especially O
since O
he O
's O
taken O
basically O
a O
one-man O
rule O
over O
with O
the O
Baath B-ORG
Party I-ORG
in O
1979 O
. O

BEGALA O
I O
agree O
. O

Therefore O
, O
was O
n't O
Dick O
Cheney O
, O
as O
the O
CEO O
of O
Halliburton B-ORG
, O
wrong O
to O
be O
selling O
oilfield O

the O
butcher O
of O
Baghdad B-LOC
in O
1988 O
? O

HAYWORTH O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
about O
any O
oil O

going O

Saddam O

What O
I O
do O
know O
in O

here O

now O
is O
... O
BEGALA O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
about O
it O
if O
you O
like O
. O

HAYWORTH O
That O
's O
fine O

And O
I O
know O
you O

BEGALA O
That O
's O
an O
important O

HAYWORTH O
No O
, O
it O

so O
important O
-- O
you O

this O

and O
I O
know O
it O
's O
fun O
and O
we O
love O
doing O
partisan O
Punch O

Judy O
, O
but O
is O
there O
ever O
a O
time O
when O
we O
stand O
up O
even O
if O
we O
respectfully O
disagree O
with O
the O
commander O
in O
chief O
and O
those O
who O
would O
wage O

Dissent O
is O
fine O

but O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
anything O
about O

Saddam O

( O

HAYWORTH O
What O
I O
do O
know O
is O
Saddam O

has O
butchered O
over O

citizens O

to O
somehow O
try O

we O
are O
dealing O

Would O
you O
have O
treated O
him O
as O

the O
way O
Dick O

did O
? O

HAYWORTH O
I O
do O
n't O
even O

Would O
you O
have O
sold O

to O
him O

Hello O

? O

We O
're O
talking O
... O
( O
CROSSTALK O

SANDERS O
What O
we O
're O
talking O
about O
is O
the O
unpredictable O
nature O
of O

what O
could O
happen O
in O
this O
war O
. O

For O
example O
-- O
wait O
a O
second O
-- O
in O
Iran B-LOC
, O
the O
reason O
that O
you O
had O
Ayatollah O
Khomeini O
in O
power O
is O
he O
overthrew O
the O
Shah O
. O

You O
who O
put O

The O

of O

HAYWORTH O
Oh O
the O
evil O
United B-LOC

SANDERS O
But O
the O
point O
is O
... O
NOVAK O
I O
want O
to O
get O
to O
that O
point O
. O

But O
the O
problem O
with O
Khomeini O
was O
that O
the O
guy O
who O
he O
overthrew O
was O
put O
in O

by O
the O
United B-LOC

I O
ca O
n't O
quite O
figure O
that O
out O

We O
overthrew O

and O
put O
the O
Shah O
of O

Everybody O

The O
CIA B-ORG
did O
that O

NOVAK O
But O
I O
mean O
you O
're O
attacking O
the O
CIA B-ORG
for O
putting O
him O
in O
, O
when O
it O
was O
-- O
the O
problem O
was O
Khomeini O
. O

SANDERS O
No O
, O
the O
point O
I O
made O
, O
Khomeini O
came O
about O
because O
we O
put O
a O
brutal O
dictator O
, O
the O
Shah O
of O
Iran B-LOC

in O
power O
. O

The O
point O
that O
I O
am O
making O
is O
you O
can O
not O
... O
HAYWORTH O
The O
point O
you O
're O
making O
is O
blame O
America B-LOC
first O
. O

SANDERS O
No O
I O
'm O
not O
. O

HAYWORTH O
That O
's O
what O
you O
're O

SANDERS O
You O

and O
it O
came O

and O
we O
got O
the O
alarm O
this O
distress O
situation O
just O
before O
5:00 O

and O
we O
were O

we O

we O

after O

we O
spotted O
the O

these O
men O
were O
in O
some O
water O
that O
was O
quite O
frigid O

if O
they O
stayed O
out O
there O
for O
long O
they O
could O
have O
suffered O

perhaps O
. O

i O
want O

you O

have O
you O
ever O

have O
you O
ever O

anything O

no O
, O
i O
have O
never O

of O

where O
you O
have O
a O
fishing O
vessel O
disappear O
, O
more O
or O
less O
. O

and O
that O
the O
survivors O
, O
they O
had O
to O
go O
into O
the O
water O
, O
pick O
them O
up O
from O
the O
water O
. O

was O
there O
any O
point O
at O
which O
you O
did O
n't O
think O
you O
would O
be O
able O
to O
pull O
it O
off O
? O

sorry O
, O
please O
say O
again O

was O
there O
any O

at O
which O
you O
thought O
you O
would O
n't O

no O
, O
absolutely O
not O
. O

we O
-- O
we O
were O
100 O
% O
sure O
we O
could O
make O
it O
, O
absolutely O
. O

because O
we O
came O
very O
close O
to O
the O
vessel O
. O

we O
had O
our O
rescue O
boat O
out O
soon O
. O

so O
i O
felt O
confident O
about O
it O
. O

i O
saw O
the O
fishermen O
also O
had O
the O
surviving O
suits O
on O
. O

so O
that O
gave O
me O
more O
time O
to O
help O
. O

that O
was O
a O
good O
thing O
for O
them O
. O

what O
about O
your O

that O
was O

are O
they O

we O
train O

this O

at O

every O

i O

what O

you O

Arafat O
? O

Was O
he O
a O
h- O
Roger O
Uh O
, O
I O
think O
that O
, O
um O
, O
I O
bet O
he O
was O
n't O
a O
really O
good O
leader O
. O

I O
think O
that O
, O
um O
, O
that O
his O
situation O
-- O
-- O
well O
, O
see O
I O
got O
to O
the O
-- O
to- O
to O
the O
level O
of O
power O
that O
he O
was O
in O
-- O
back O
in O
the O
eighties O
-- O
and O
once O
he O
, O
um O
, O
you O
know O
, O
started O
getting O
wealthy O
and O
started O
getting O
known O
, O
that O
his O
agenda O
ch- O
uh O
, O
changed O
Barb O
Mhm O
. O

Roger O
but O
it O
was O
n't O
actually O
for O
peace O
but O
was O
to O
try O
to O
find O
a O
way O
to O
( O
( O
send O
) O
) O
the O
Israelis O
out O
of O
Jerusalem B-LOC
in O
the O
areas O
that O
they O
wanted O
. O

I O
really O
do O
n't O
think O
that O
-- O
they O
wanted O
to O
coexist O
. O

I O
think O
that O
, O
um O
, O
he O
wanted O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
all O
his O
people O
-- O
all O
his O
people O
wanted O
to O
coexist O
with O
the O
-- O
Israelis O
. O

I O
think O
that O
, O
um O
, O
his O
death O
-- O
marks O
a O
beginning O
of O
trying O
to O
find O
somebody O
that O
-- O
really O
wants O
peace O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
that O
in O
that O
area O
of O
the O
, O
um O
, O
world O
that O
you O
could O
actually O
have O
peace O
. O

If O
you O
know O
the O
Bible O
well O
you O
would O
know O
that O
there O
's O
always O
going O
to O
be O
a O
conflict O
there O
. O

Um O
, O
I O
think O
that O
, O
uh O
, O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
should O
open O
up O
-- O
their O
-- O
doors O
to O
-- O
not O
help O

but O
support O
any O
, O
um O
, O
process O
for O
peace O
in O
the O
area O
, O
though O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
that O
we O
should O
get O
involved O
to O
a O
level O
, O
a O
point O
where O
we O
're O
sending O
people O
over O
there O
and O
, O
um O
, O
trying O
to O
-- O
help O
keep O
the O
peace O
or O
anything O
like O
that O
, O
um O
. O

There O
's O
a O
lot O
of O
stuff O
that O
can O
be O
done O
-- O
by O
just O
verbal O
suppo- O
-- O
you O
know O
. O

I O
think O
that O
now O
he O
's O
gone O
, O
his O
family O
is O
still O
around O
, O
and O
Barb O
Yeah O
. O

Roger O
uh O
, O
millions O
and O
millions O
of O
dollars O
that O
he O
had O
is O
still O
around O
but O
they O
-- O
if O
they O
bring O
people O
in O
that O
was O
n't O
involved O
with O
his O
cabinet O
, O
n- O
um O
, O
have O
different O
views O
than O
him O
, O
somebody O
that O
gener- O
genuinely O
can O
accept O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
Israel- O
-- O
Is- O
Israelis O
are O
there O
and O
they O
're O
there O
to O
stay O
-- O
and O
, O
um O
, O
we O
going O
to O
have O
to O
find O
a O
way O
to O
coexist O
. O

If O
they O
can O
find O
somebody O
like O
that O
, O
then O
I O
think O
that O
they O
should O
f- O
support O
him O
and O
, O
um O
, O
and O
back O
him O
up O
-- O
in O
trying O
to O
help O
define O
-- O
peace O
in O
the O
area O
where O
peace O
is O
impossible O
. O

What O
do O
you O
think O
about O
it O
? O

Barb O
I O
agree O
with O
you O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
know O
that O
much O
about O
it O
, O
I O
was O
n't O
much O
into O
politics O
back O
in O
the O
eighties O
. O

I O
was O
more O
, O
um O
, O
kind O
of O
a O
-- O
I O
was O
a O
kid O
on O
the O
run O
from O
abusive O
parents O
back O
then O
so O
that O
was O
n't O
a O
, O
you O
know O
, O
one O
of O
my O
topics O
of O
interest O
at O
the O

it O

now O

Um O
, O
I O
-- O
my O
roommate O
, O
and O
I O
still O
do O
n't O
know O
that O
much O
about O
-- O
I O
'd O
love O
to O
know O
more O
about O
politics O
and O
I O
'm O
trying O
to O
learn O
more O
, O
uh O
, O
tells O
me O
, O
you O
know O
, O
he O
was O
such O
a O
terrible O
man O
but O
, O
eh O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
listen O
to O
everything O
he O
says O
. O

And O
I O
think O
it O
-- O
-- O
I O
mean O
, O
it O
would O
be O
nice O
to O
have O
peace O
over O
there O
, O
but O
I O
agree O
with O
you O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
's O
ever O
going O
to O
happen O
. O

I O
mean O
, O
not O
the O
way O
-- O
-- O
not O
the O
way O
they O
'll O
-- O
-- O
not O
like O
it O
is O
here O
. O

And O
I O
agree O
that O
we O
should O
n't O
send O
people O
over O
there O
. O

We O
've O
got O
enough O
stuff O
going O
on O
with O
Roger O
Yeah O
. O

Barb O
Iraq B-LOC
and O
I- O
and O
, O
um O
, O
the O
-- O
other O
-- O
-- O
the O
other O
guy O
. O

Roger O
Yeah O
. O

Barb O
We O
got O
way O
too O
much O
going O
and O
too O
much O
expense O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
we O
we O
ca O
n't O
, O
the O
that's O
Roger O
Yeah O
. O

Barb O
that O
would O
be O
just O
putting O
it O
over O
the O
edge O
right O
there O
. O

But O
I O
think O
ought O
support O
, O
you O
know O
, O
a O
man O
that O
, O
Roger O
Mhm O
. O

Barb O
like O
you O
said O
, O
is O
-- O
would O
like O
to O
coexist O
-- O
with O
everybody O
and O
somebody O
that O
is O
Roger O
Yeah O
. O

Barb O
peaceful O
-- O
and O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
I O
'd O
like O

learn O

how O

I O

Roger O
Yeah O
, O
and O
, O
um O
, O
I O
only O
know O
about O
Yasser O

because O
I O
, O
um O
, O
study O

a O
little O
bit O
-- O
and O
I O
know O
-- O
a O
very O
little O
bit O
about O
him O
because O
, O
of O
course O
he O
was O
a O
, O
um O
, O
leader O
for O
a O
long O
time O
, O
longer O
than O
the O
age O
that O
I O
am O
-- O
old O
, O
so O
, O
but O
I- O
I- O
I- O
I O
've O
noticed O
-- O
on O
throughout O
my O
studies O
that O
-- O
what O
he O
represented O
to O
the O
public O
-- O
was O
-- O
what O
he O
represented O
to O
the O
international O
public O
-- O
was O
not O
what O
he O
was O
representing O
to O
his O
people O
-- O
and O
he O
was O
representing O
, O
um O
, O
peace O
with O
the O
Israelis O
and O
he O
was O
representing O
trying O
to O
find O

( O
the O

that O

um O
, O
stop O

um O
, O
uh O
, O
war O
and O
terrorists O
in O
the O

. O

But O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
that O
he O
had O
the O
same O
image O
to- O
to O
his O
people O
. O

I O
think O
that O
it O
was O
a O
front O
-- O
for O
him O
to O
allow O
to O
to O
be O
accepted O
in O
an O
international O
community O
, O
but O
I O
think O
-- O
that O
his O
ultimate O
plans O
and O
goals O
were O
to O
to O
run O
the O
Israelis O
out O
-- O
maybe O
closer O
to O
the O
Gaza B-LOC

and O
to O
re-take O
Jerusalem B-LOC
-- O
and O
other O

to O

uh O
, O
uplift O

a O
way O
that O
-- O
they O
could O
say O
, O
you O
know O
, O
we O
conquered O
the O

It O
's O
a O
matter O
of O
, O
uh O
-- O
I O

, O
it O
's O
more O
than O
just O

, O
it O
's O
a O

, O
conflict O

Curt O
Got O
ta O
hate O
the O
French O
, O
I O
really O
do O
n't O
think O
there O
is O
anything O
good O
you O
can O
say O
about O
the O
French O
anymore O
, O
they O
are O
a O
waste O
and O
a O
joke O
of O
a O
government O
. O

Apparently O
Bush O
wants O
the O
European's B-LOC
to O
classify O
Hezbollah B-ORG
as O
a O
terrorist O
group O
. O

Makes O
sense O
right O
? O

As O
rising O
instability O
in O
Lebanon B-LOC
increases O
tensions O
in O
the O
Middle B-LOC
East I-LOC
, O
the O
Bush O
administration O
is O
arguing O
with O
European B-LOC
governments O
over O
whether O
they O
should O
designate O
the O
Lebanon-based B-LOC
Shiite O
group O
Hezbollah B-ORG
a O
terrorist O
organization O
, O
American B-LOC
and O
European B-LOC
officials O
say O
. O

The O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
is O
already O
stepping O
up O
pressure O
on O
Iran B-LOC
and O
Syria B-LOC
, O
Hezbollah B-ORG
's O
main O
sponsors O
. O

The O
American B-LOC
rift O
with O
Syria B-LOC
deepened O
this O
week O
, O
with O
suspicions O
that O
Syria B-LOC
might O
have O
been O
behind O
the O
assassination O
of O
Lebanon B-LOC
's O
former O
prime O
minister O
in O
Beirut B-LOC
on O
Monday O
. O

... O

In O
the O
past O
two O
weeks O
, O
the O
officials O
said O
, O
France B-LOC
has O
rebuffed O
appeals O
by O
Secretary O
of O
State O
Condoleezza O
Rice O
and O
the O
Israeli B-LOC
foreign O
minister O
, O
Silvan O
Shalom O
, O
to O
list O
Hezbollah B-ORG
as O
a O
terrorist O
organization O
, O
which O
would O
prevent O
it O
from O
raising O
money O
in O
Europe B-LOC
through O
charity O
groups O
. O

The O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
has O
long O
called O
Hezbollah B-ORG
a O
terrorist O
organization O
, O
but O
the O
French B-LOC
, O
American B-LOC
and O
European B-LOC
officials O
said O
, O
have O
opposed O
doing O
so O
, O
and O
argue O
that O
making O
such O
a O
designation O
now O
would O
be O
unwise O
, O
given O
the O
new O
turbulence O
in O
Lebanon B-LOC
. O

Israeli B-LOC
and O
American B-LOC
officials O
say O
that O
the O
Palestinian B-LOC
president O
, O
Mahmoud O
Abbas O
, O
has O
told O
them O
that O
he O
, O
too O
, O
regards O
Hezbollah B-ORG
as O
a O
destructive O
force O
in O
the O
Middle B-LOC
East I-LOC
, O
one O
determined O
to O
undermine O
peace O
talks O
by O
supporting O
militant O
groups O
that O
attack O
Israelis O
. O

Got O
ta O
love O
that O
. O

The O
Palestinian B-LOC
president O
admits O
that O
Hezbollah B-ORG
are O
a O
bunch O
of O
f-wad O
terrorists O
but O
the O
French O
do O
n't O
agree O
... O
.No O
joke O
. O

The O
Europeans O
are O
not O
solidly O
opposed O
to O
listing O
Hezbollah B-ORG
as O
a O
terrorist O
group O
, O
the O
officials O
said O
. O

The O
Netherlands B-LOC
, O
Italy B-LOC
and O
Poland B-LOC
support O
the O
Bush O
administration O
's O
view O
, O
several O
officials O
said O
, O
while O
Germany B-LOC
and O
Britain B-LOC
believe O
the O
issue O
is O
moot O
unless O
the O
French O
change O
their O
minds O
. O

One O
European B-LOC
diplomat O
said O
other O
countries O
were O
`` O
hiding O
behind O
'' O
France B-LOC
on O
the O
issue O
. O

... O
A O
European B-LOC
diplomat O
said O
the O
issue O
of O
calling O
Hezbollah B-ORG
a O
terrorist O
organization O
was O
discussed O
in O
Brussels B-LOC
on O
Wednesday O
at O
a O
meeting O
of O
the O
Clearing B-ORG
House I-ORG
, O
a O
unit O
of O
the O
European B-ORG
Union I-ORG
that O
meets O
in O
confidential O
sessions O
to O
review O
terrorist O
activities O
in O
Europe B-LOC
. O

The O
group O
could O
reach O
no O
consensus O
, O
the O
diplomat O
said O
. O

`` O
Nothing O
is O
going O
to O
change O
on O
Hezbollah B-ORG
because O
we O
do O
n't O
have O
an O
agreement O
among O
the O
member O
states O
, O
'' O
the O
diplomat O
said O
. O

`` O
That O
does O
n't O
mean O
we O
wo O
n't O
get O
a O
consensus O
. O

I O
know O
the O
Americans O
are O
impatient O
, O
but O
the O
European B-ORG
Union I-ORG
has O
25 O
states O
, O
and O
these O
things O
take O
time O
. O
'' O

Some O
of O
those O
interviewed O
tried O
to O
make O
it O
sound O
as O
if O
the O
reason O
they O
are O
hesitant O
to O
go O
along O
with O
Bush O
is O
because O
of O
the O
situation O
in O
Lebanon B-LOC
. O

But O
as O
The O
Captain O
points O
out O
, O
it O
probably O
has O
more O
to O
do O
with O
Iran B-LOC
: O
I O
suspect O
the O
true O
reason O
for O
the O
reluctance O
comes O
not O
from O
the O
'' O
delicate O
'' O
nature O
of O
Lebanese B-LOC
politics O
, O
but O
from O
the O
relationship O
between O
Hezbollah B-ORG
and O
the O
Iranians O
. O

The O
EU B-ORG
has O
tried O
for O
the O
past O
two O
years O
to O
appease O
the O
Iranian B-LOC
mullahs O
into O
giving O
up O
their O
nuclear-weapons O
ambitions O
to O
little O
avail O
. O

They O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
rock O
the O
boat O
now O
by O
attempting O
to O
starve O
out O
the O
mullahs O
' O
terror O
agent O
that O
conducts O
the O
proxy O
attacks O
against O
Israel B-LOC
that O
Iran B-LOC
can O
not O
afford O
to O
do O
itself O
openly O
. O

They O
did O
not O
learn O
from O
Hitler O
's O
Germany B-LOC
I O
guess O
, O
they O
tried O
to O
appease O
that O
guy O
too O
. O

This O
whole O
thing O
just O
reminds O
me O
how O
corrupt O
and O
useless O
France B-LOC
is O
. O

They O
will O
forever O
be O
known O
as O
that O
corrupt O
and O
cowards O
in O
my O
opinion O

all O
the O

the O

the O

Yesterday O
we O
were O
about O
50 O

the O

perhaps O
100 O

There O
were O

Many O

felt O
at O

the O
success O
of O

was O
due O
entirely O
to O
the O

or O

in O

to O
the O
dissensions O
in O
the O
Democratic B-ORG
party I-ORG
, O
which O
divided O
its O
vote O
between O
Breckinridge O
and O
Douglas O

What O
merely O
moral O
strength O
the O
Democratic B-ORG
party I-ORG
would O
have O
gained O
had O
it O
remained O
united O
, O
it O
is O
impossible O
to O
estimate O
. O

Such O
a O
supposition O
can O
only O
be O
based O
on O
the O
absence O
of O
the O
extreme O
Southern B-LOC
doctrines O
concerning O
slavery O
. O

Given O
the O
presence O
of O
those O
doctrines O

the O
canvass O

no O
hypothesis O
can O
furnish O
a O
result O

from O
that O
which O

In O
the O
contest O
upon O
the O
questions O
as O
they O
existed O

the O

If O

Hay O
See O
for O
a O
confirmation O
of O
the O
electoral O
arithmetic O
: O
the O
states O
where O
Lincoln O
got O
an O
abolute O
majority O
of O
the O
popular O
vote O
( O
i.e. O
, O
all O
the O
free O
states O
except O
Oregon B-LOC

California B-LOC

New B-LOC
Jersey I-LOC
) O
were O
sufficient O
to O
bring O
him O
a O
majority O
in O
the O
Electoral O
College O
. O

The O
reason O
that O
Lincoln O
could O
get O
an O
electoral O
majority O
with O
only O
forty O
percent O
of O
the O
popular O
vote O
was O
not O
that O
his O
opposition O
was O
divided O
but O
that O
he O
had O
far O
fewer O
`` O
wasted O
'' O
votes O
than O
his O
opponents O
-- O
in O
ten O
southern O
states O
he O
got O
no O
popular O
votes O
at O
all O
. O

It O
can O
of O
course O
be O
argued O
that O
the O
candidate O
of O
a O
united O
anti-Lincoln O
opposition O
might O
have O
done O
better O
than O
all O
the O
OTL O
anti-Lincoln O
candidates O
combined O
, O
because O
the O
mere O
fact O
of O
the O
divided O
nature O
of O
Lincoln's O
opposition O
might O
have O
discouraged O
anti-Lincoln O
men O
and O
led O
to O
fewer O
of O
them O
voting O
than O
would O
otherwise O
be O
the O
case O
. O

But O
given O
that O
turnout O
was O
quite O
high O
in O
1860 O
, O
I O
doubt O
this O
. O

One O
thing O
seems O
reasonably O
clear O
to O
me O
: O
if O
there O
was O
to O
be O
a O
united O
anti- O
Lincoln O
opposition O
, O
Douglas O
could O
not O
lead O
it O
. O

He O
was O
hated O
too O
much O
in O
the O
South B-LOC
for O
his O
opposition O
to O
the O
admission O
of O
Kansas B-LOC
as O
a O
state O
under O
the O
pro-slavery O
Lecompton O
Constitution O
and O
for O
his O
interpretation O
of O
Dred O
Scott O
as O
still O
allowing O
territories O
to O
exclude O
slavery O
through O
unfriendly O
local O
legislation O
. O

( O
See O
for O
Douglas O
's O
defense O
of O
his O
position O

He O
and O
Breckinridge O

Bell O
would O
have O
to O
withdraw O
in O
favor O
of O
a O
compromise O
candidate O
-- O
former O
governor O
Horatio O
Seymour O
of O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
was O
one O
proposal O
. O

But O
I O
doubt O
that O
Seymour O
would O
have O
been O
able O
to O
do O
better O
than O
all O
the O
combined O
OTL O
anti-Lincoln O
candidates O
in O
such O
close O
states O
as O
Illinois B-LOC
and O
Indiana B-LOC
And O
his O
own O
state O
of O

not O
really O

it O

is O
it O
the O
U.S B-LOC

and O

supply O

? O

Or O
both O
? O

LANG O
Well O
, O
they O
are O
close O
enough O
up O
to O
Baghdad B-LOC
now O
so O
that O
the O
supply O
line O
issue O
is O
probably O
not O
a O
big O
one O
since O
they O
had O
time O
to O
restock O
, O
food O
, O
fuel O
and O
ammunition O
. O

So O
, O
probably O
the O
main O
thing O
is O
combing O
through O
the O
rubble O
that O
the O
air B-ORG
force I-ORG
has O
left O
of O
these O
Republican B-ORG

divisions O
to O
make O
sure O
there O
are O
no O
strong O
points O
that O
you O
leave O
behind O
, O
that O
could O
threaten O
your O
lines O
of O
supply O
once O
they O
get O
past O
. O

Once O
they O
are O
satisfied O
they O
are O
through O
all O
that O
, O
I O
would O
imaging O
there O
will O
be O
a O
pause O
while O
they O

hard O

how O
much O

there O
really O
is O

O'BRIEN O
Well O
, O
let O
me O
ask O
you O
that O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
I O
just O
wanted O
to O
tell O
viewers O
where O
we O
just O
took O
our O
satellite O
imagery O
. O

This O
is O
that O
Karbala B-LOC
area O
which O
is O
about O
50 O
miles O
from O
Baghdad B-LOC
. O

Baghdad B-LOC
is O
roughly O
in O
that O
direction O
from O
there O
. O

We O
know O
the O
vanguard O
is O
supposedly O
as O
close O
as O
15 O
miles O
. O

One O
of O
the O
next O
key O
points O
along O
the O
way O
here O
is O
Saddam O
international O
airport O
. O

Do O
you O
suppose O
that O
is O
a O
key O
target O
right O
now O
? O

LANG O
Oh O
, O
I O
'm O
sure O
it O
is O
. O

I O
mean O
a O
feature O
of O
that O
importance O
would O
always O
be O
something O
you O
'd O
want O
to O
hold O
. O

And O
besides O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
you O
get O
control O
of O
it O
you O
'd O
be O
able O
to O
start O
using O
it O
for O
air O
operations O
, O
and O
put O
a O
survey O
team O
in O
there O
as O
soon O
as O
it O
's O
secured O
, O
and O
then O
start O
using O
it O
for O
helicopter O
operations O
, O
haul O
forward O
some O
big O
bladders O
of O
fuel O
to O
refuel O
helicopters O
and O
rearm O
them O
and O
things O
like O
that O
. O

And O
if O
the O
front O
stabilizes O
between O
there O
and O
the O
downtown O
Baghdad O
, O
they O
'll O
start O
using O
it O
for O
a O
fixed O
wing O
aircraft O
as O
well O
. O

O'BRIEN O
Now O
, O
as O
you O
go O
from O
Saddam O
International O
Airport O
into O
town O
you O
see O
there O
are O
some O
big O
, O
wide O
divided O
highways O
there O
. O

Control O
of O
these O
highways O
will O
be O
crucial O
wo O
n't O
it O
? O

LANG O
Yeah O
, O
these O
are O
the O
high-speed O
approaches O
into O
the O
heart O
of O
the O
city O
and O
armored O
forces O
like O
the O
3rd O
Mechanized O
Infantry O
Division O
just O
love O
high-speed O
approaches O
. O

They O
will O
try O
to O
go O
down O
those O
things O
, O
cutting O
the O
city O
up O
into O
sectors O
as O
best O
they O
can O
, O
and O
then O
work O
on O
the O
specific O
sectors O
of O
the O
city O
they O
think O
are O
a O
key O
terrain O
. O

I O
would O
think O
, O
probably O
, O
various O
facilities O
as O
well O
as O
major O
government O
buildings O
that O
they O
need O
to O
control O
to O
set O
up O
a O
new O
government O
. O

O'BRIEN O
It O
's O
a O
big O
city O
, O
about O
the O
size O
of O
Philadelphia B-LOC
or O
thereabouts O
. O

Some O
have O
said O
Chicago B-LOC
is O
a O
good O
analogy O
. O

Tremendous O
amount O
of O
force O
needed O
to O
control O
a O
city O
of O
that O
source O
, O
or O
am O
a O
wrong O
? O

LANG O
Well O
, O
it O
depends O
on O
the O
attitude O
of O
the O
populous O
, O
which O
is O
not O
clear O
yet O
. O

If O
the O
population O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
or O
at O
least O
a O
big O
part O
of O
them O
like O
the O
Shia O
half O
of O
the O
population O
, O
if O
they O
want O
to O
be O
liberated O
, O
then O
you O
can O
control O
them O
with O
a O
fairly O
small O
force O
. O

If O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
in O
the O
city O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
be O
liberated O
and O
you O
're O
never O
going O
to O
know O
that O
until O
you O
try O
, O
then O
you O
're O
going O
to O
need O
a O
much O
larger O
force O
, O
and O
we O
might O
end O
up O
waiting O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
for O
reinforcements O
. O

O'BRIEN O
Based O
on O
what O
you O
've O
seen O
so O
far O
, O
what O
is O
your O
sense O
of O
that O
? O

The O
Shias O
are O
a O
bit O
gun O
shy O
, O
if O
you O
will O
, O
in O
the O
south O
because O
of O
what O
happened O
in O
1991 O
. O

They O
rose O
up O
, O
did O
n't O
get O
American B-LOC

. O

Do O
you O
suppose O
it O
will O
be O
a O
different O
story O
in O
Baghdad B-LOC

Is O
there O
a O
lot O
of O
latent O

that O
will O
come O
out O
? O

LANG O
Yes O
, O
there O
is O
, O
but O
these O
folks O
are O
going O
to O
be O
mighty O
cautious O
. O

They O
have O
a O
long O
history O
of O
being O
kicked O
around O
by O
the O
Sunni O
Arab O

And O
they O

talk O

what O
barbara O

was O

she O
says O
there O
is O
an O
acknowledgment O

not O

particularly O
in O
baghdad B-LOC

control O
what O
our O
nic O
robertson O
is O
saying O
is O
a O
stage O
of O
anarchy O
in O
some O
parts O
of O
iraq B-LOC
. O

do O
you O
think O
the O
administration O
underestimated O
the O
day O
after O
? O

i O
think O
because O
the O
day O
after O
came O
so O
fast O
and O
so O
suddenly O
in O
way O
. O

i O
think O
that O
there O
's O
been O
a O
pattern O
here O
not O
just O
with O
this O
administration O
, O
but O
over O
the O
last O
ten O
years O
, O
bosnia B-LOC
, O
kosovo B-LOC
, O
afghanistan B-LOC
, O
where O
we O
do O
n't O
quite O
recognize O
when O
the O
old O
order O
collapses O
, O
you O
very O
quickly O
have O
to O
rush O
in O
and O
fill O
it O
with O
some O
kind O
of O
new O
order O
. O

in O
the O
short-term O
, O
that O
's O
going O
to O
have O
to O
mean O
the O
american B-LOC
military O
. O

but O
the O
key O
question O
, O
which O
i O
try O
to O
address O
in O
the O
book O
, O
is O
what O
do O
you O
do O
after O
that O
? O

what O
kind O
of O
authority O
do O
you O
create O
in O
a O
society O
going O
through O
this O
kind O
of O
transition O
. O

and O
how O
do O
you O
know O
that O
the O
local O
iraqi B-LOC
citizens O
will O
make O
up O
this O
government O
or O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
interested O
in O
democracy O
? O

there O
's O
no O
proof O
of O
that O
. O

well O
, O
the O
key O
here O
is O
the O
only O
way O
to O
get O
that O
kind O
of O
legitimate O
government O
to O
have O
it O
look O
good O
is O
to O
hold O
elections O
. O

but O
if O
you O
hold O
elections O
, O
you O
stop O
the O
whole O
process O
of O
building O
a O
rule O
of O
law O
, O
creating O
courts O
, O
creating O
administration O
. O

we O
've O
seen O
in O
the O
past O
in O
bosnia B-LOC
for O
example O
, O
you O
held O
elections O
and O
all O
of O
the O
old O
ethnic O
thugs O
get O
into O
power O
because O
they O
have O
organization O
and O
they O
have O
money O
and O
they O
stop O
the O
process O
of O
genuine O
building O
of O
democracy O
. O

there O
is O
this O
tension O
here O
which O
is O
the O
only O
way O
to O
make O
this O
look O
good O
is O
in O
some O
way O
get O
legitimate O
iraqi B-LOC
authority O
, O
but O
the O
faster O
you O
get O
that O
, O
the O
more O
likely O
you O
stop O
this O
process O
. O

so O
what O
do O
you O
think O
of O
this O
interim O
government O
? O

you O
got O
deputy O
defense O
secretary O
paul O
wolfowitz O
saying O
that O
american B-LOC
and O
british B-LOC
military O
forces O
would O
play O
a O
leading O
role O
in O
setting O
up O
an O
iraqi B-LOC
government O
and O
then O
later O
draw O
civilians O
into O
the O
process O
. O

is O
that O
going O
to O
work O
? O

i O
think O
it O
will O
work O
if O
it O
's O
truly O
broad-based O

truly O
consensual O
, O
try O
and O
include O

MILITARY O
AFFAIRS O
CORRESPONDENT O
Well O
Judy O
, O
the O
Pentagon B-ORG
is O
beginning O
to O
see O
positive O
signs O
that O
it O
hadn't O
seen O
for O
awhile O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
as O
we O
saw O
just O
a O
few O
moments O
ago O
on O
CNN B-ORG
, O
the O
pictures O
of O
some O
of O
the O
actual O
happy O
Iraqi B-LOC
citizens O
welcoming O
U.S B-LOC
. O

troops O
, O
that O
taking O
place O
in O
Najaf B-LOC
. O

Also O
the O
Pentagon B-ORG
is O
seeing O
lighter O
than O
expected O
resistance O
indicating O
at O
least O
that O
they O
may O
have O
really O
seriously O
degraded O
those O
Republican B-ORG
Guard I-ORG
divisions O
before O
the O
U.S B-LOC
. O

troops O
arrived O
, O
both O
in O
Karbala B-LOC
and O
also O
in O
Al B-LOC
Kut I-LOC
. O

They O
met O
lighter O
than O
expected O
resistance O
. O

But O
the O
Pentagon B-ORG
officials O
stress O
that O
as O
they O
close O
in O
on O
Baghdad B-LOC
, O
this O
becomes O
the O
real O
dangerous O
part O
as O
they O
enter O
that O
so- O
called O
red O
zone O
where O
Saddam O
Hussein O
is O
believed O
to O
have O
given O
his O
commanders O
authority O
to O
use O
chemical O
weapons O
, O
and O
that O
use O
of O
chemical O
weapons O
remains O
a O
real O
fear O
at O
the O
Pentagon O

So O
, O
in O

that O
, O
we O
are O
paying O
great O
attention O
to O
their O
ability O
to O
defend O
on O

They O
may O
just O
suddenly O
be O
effective O
on O
the O
ground O

Additionally O
, O
their O
ability O
to O
use O
chemical O
and O
biological O
weapons O
, O
they O
've O
proven O
it O
historically O
. O

We O
believe O
they O
have O
the O
capability O
now O
. O

Clearly O
, O
as O
we O
threaten O
the O
core O
of O
the O
regime O
, O
which O
Baghdad B-LOC

Tikrit B-LOC
represent O
, O
we O
believe O
that O
the O
likelihood O
of O
them O
using O

goes O

back O
memories O

Is O
there O

MCINTYRE O
Well O
, O
they O
might O

And O
that O
might O
be O
a O
good O
thing O

They O
are O
taking O
it O
very O
cautiously O
. O

No O
one O
, O
again O
, O
they O
stress O
the O
most O
dangerous O
part O
of O
this O
could O
be O
ahead O
. O

Could O
be O
urban O
combat O

Could O
involve O

Could O
be O
the O
most O
loyal O

left O

they O
draw O
into O
Baghdad B-LOC

Could O
be O
a O
very O
dangerous O
time O

They O
also O
are O
careful O
to O
point O
out O
that O
even O
while O
they O
say O
that O
the O

has O
been O
destroyed O

they O

WOODRUFF O
Some O
pictures O

Well O
, O
Laith O
Kubba O
is O
an O
Iraqi B-LOC
exile O
who O
has O
family O
members O
in O
Iraq B-LOC
. O

Mr. O
Kubba O
is O
a O
senior O
fellow O
at O
a O
think O
tank O
called O
the O
National B-ORG
Endowment O
for O
Democracy B-ORG
. O

He O
is O
also O
the O
president O
of O
a O
group O
of O
Iraqi B-LOC
exiles O
, O
a O
group O
called O
the O
Iraq B-ORG
National O
Group B-ORG
. O

He O
joins O
us O
now O
from O
London B-LOC
to O
talk O
about O
rebuilding O
his O
country O
. O

Mr. O
Kubba O
, O
first O
of O
all O
, O
your O
thoughts O
as O
you O
've O
watched O
these O
scenes O
of O
Baghdad B-LOC
, O
the O
Saddam O
Hussein O
regime O
falling O
in O
the O
last O
day O
? O

LAITH O
KUBBA O
, O
PRESIDENT O
, O
IRAQI B-ORG
NATIONAL O
GROUP B-ORG
It O
is O
a O
huge O
sigh O
of O
relief O
, O
because O
it O
could O
have O
been O
much O
worse O
and O
Baghdad B-LOC
could O
have O
been O
a O
war O
theater O
with O
more O
destruction O
to O
property O
. O

And O
, O
obviously O
, O
there O
are O
four O
million O
people O
who O
could O
have O
suffered O
more O
. O

So O
, O
there O
is O
a O
sigh O
of O
relief O
that O
it O
is O
not O
worse O
. O

But O
, O
obviously O
, O
there O
is O
a O
great O
, O
great O
concern O
about O
the O
scenes O
that O
you O
've O
been O
showing O
on O
television O
. O

WOODRUFF O
Are O
you O
talking O
to O
family O
members O
now O
in O
Baghdad B-LOC
and O
around O
Iraq B-LOC
? O

And O
, O
if O
you O
are O
, O
how O
concerned O
are O
they O
about O
the O
lawlessness O
? O

KUBBA O
Well O
, O
not O
in O
the O
recent O
three O
or O
four O
days O
. O

There O
are O
no O
phone O
lines O
to O
Baghdad B-LOC
. O

In O
other O
parts O
of O
Iraq B-LOC
, O
I O
received O
with O
great O
sadness O
the O
killing O
of O
one O
close O
colleague O
, O
Saeed O
Abu O
Naji O
Abhuey O
( O
ph O
) O
in O
Najaf B-LOC
. O

He O
was O
not O
killed O
by O
former O
members O
of O
the O
Baath B-ORG
Party I-ORG
or O
the O
security O
of O
the O
army O
, O
but O
by O
just O
a O
local O
organized O
group O
. O

So O
those O
signs O
to O
me O
are O
worrying O
. O

People O
are O
sensing O
and O
feeling O
the O
lack O
of O
authority O
or O
the O
power O
vacuum O
and O
are O
testing O
it O
. O

And O
the O
more O
they O
test O
, O
the O
more O
I O
think O
they O
are O
claiming O
. O

WOODRUFF O
How O
difficult O
will O
it O
be O
to O
sort O
out O
who O
will O
next O
hold O
power O
in O
Iraq B-LOC
after O
this O
transition O
period O
, O
however O
long O
it O
is O
, O
where O
the O
U.S B-LOC
. O

is O
in O
charge O
? O

KUBBA O
Well O
, O
one O
needs O
to O
break O
down O
this O
process O
into O
various O
elements O
. O

Today O
, O
there O
should O
be O
an O
authority O
. O

And O
it O
's O
very O
likely O
that O
the O
U.S B-LOC
. O

and O
the O
British B-LOC
forces O
are O
the O
authority O
on O
land O
. O

And O
there O
ought O
to O
be O
administration O
. O

And O
this O
ought O
to O
be O
primarily O
by O
Iraqis O
. O

But O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
government O
, O
I O
think O
we O
really O
need O
to O
map O
out O
step O
by O
step O
how O
to O
move O
from O
this O
power O
vacuum O
to O
the O
day O
we O
have O
elections O
. O

We O
need O
to O
involve O
the O
U.N B-ORG
. O

We O
need O
to O
involve O
all O
Iraqi B-LOC
forces O
in O
the O
country O
, O
outside O
the O
country O
. O

But O
we O
need O
to O
do O
it O
quickly O
, O
because O
every O
day O
passes O
by O
with O
this O
vacuum O
, O
it O
's O
going O
to O
spell O
trouble O
. O

WOODRUFF O
Well O
, O
we O
know O
, O
Mr. O
Kubba O
, O
there O
are O
several O
Iraqi B-LOC
exiles O
groups O
competing O
for O
influence O
. O

Is O
one O
of O
them O
going O
to O
have O
an O
advantage O
? O

And O
, O
particularly O
, O
I O
have O
in O
mind O
the O
Iraqi B-ORG
National O
Congress B-ORG
that O
Mr. O
Chalabi O
, O
who O
was O
assisted O
by O
U.S B-LOC
. O

forces O
in O
getting O
back O
into O
Iraq B-LOC
? O

KUBBA O
I O
think O
it O
's O
one O
thing O
to O
gain O
fame O
and O
access O
to O
Washington B-LOC
. O

It's O
totally O
another O
to O
gain O
legitimacy O
and O
functioning O
grounds O
inside O
Iraq B-LOC
. O

And O
I O
think O
plans O
must O
not O
be O
drawn O
in O
thin O
air O
out O
in O
Washington B-LOC
. O

It O
must O
really O
be O
drawn O
on O
the O
ground O
inside O
Iraq B-LOC
. O

And O
there O
are O
22 O
million O
people O
there O
. O

It O
's O
not O
a O
void O
. O

It O
's O
not O
a O
vacuum O
. O

And O
I O
think O
all O
plans O
must O
be O
anchored O
there O
in O
Iraq B-LOC
in O
its O
reality O
. O

WOODRUFF O
So O
does O
one O
group O
have O
an O
advantage O
over O
another O
now O
? O

KUBBA O
There O
are O
different O
groups O
who O
have O
advantage O
over O
others O
in O
different O
parts O
of O
the O
country O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
we O
do O
not O
have O
a O
national O
group O
that O
can O
appeal O
to O
Iraqis O
as O
Iraqis O
within O
a O
credible O
voice.This O
needs O
to O
be O
constructed O
, O
maybe O
through O
a O
conference O
to O
be O
held O
in O
Baghdad B-LOC
, O
where O
representatives O
from O
provinces O
all O
over O
Iraq B-LOC
need O
to O
participate O
, O
as O
well O
as O
political O
groups O
. O

But O
we O
do O
not O
have O
a O
single O
group O
, O
a O
single O
leadership O
or O
a O
single O
council O
yet O
. O

WOODRUFF O
We O
're O
talking O
with O

who O
is O
the O

two O
of O
the O

failures O
in O

happened O
-- O
not O
recognizing O

Sept. O

and O
wrongly O
claiming O
that O
Saddam O

a O

Even O

quickly O

start O
moving O

at O
this O
point O
I O

we O
're O
going O
to O
see O
our O
troops O
over O
there O
at O
least O
through O
the O
end O
of O
the O
decade O
. O

And O
Bremer O
decided O
to O
destroy O
the O
existing O
Iraqi B-LOC
army O
, O
leaving O
it O
up O
to O
us O
and O
new O

to O
try O
to O

. O

This O
is O
just O
one O
more O
of O
those O
wierd O
, O
through-the-looking-glass O
moments O
when O
Bush O
is O
trying O
to O
make O
something O
that O
at O
the O
very O
least O
has O
to O
be O
seen O
as O
troubling O

and O
that O
I O
consider O
an O
unmitigated O
failure O

the O

it O

So O
you O

you O
have O

state-specific O

But O
these O

[ O

and O
this O
plan O
will O
help O
our O
small O
business O
sector O
. O

the O
benefits O
of O
the O
growth O
plan O
will O
come O
from O
uncreased O
consumer O

and O
, O
as O
importantly O
, O
from O
a O
lower O
income O
tax O

on O
the O
small O

themselves O
. O

it O
is O
important O
for O
our O
fellow O
citizens O
to O
understand O
that O
most O
small O
businesses O
pay O
their O
business O
taxes O
at O
the O
individual O
rates O
. O

most O
small O
businesses O
are O
sole O
proprietorships O
, O
limited O
partnerships O
, O
are O
subchapter O

, O
and O
, O
therefore O
, O
when O
you O
reduce O
individual O
tax O
rates O
, O
you O
benefit O
small O
business O
formation O
. O

as O
a O
matter O
of O
fact O
, O
under O
this O
plan O
, O
some O
23 O
million O
small O
business O
owners O
will O
see O
their O
taxes O
cut O
. O

which O
leaves O
more O
money O
for O
investment O
, O
more O
money O
for O
growth O
, O
more O
money O
for O
job O
creation O
. O

a O
growing O
economy O
also O
needs O
small O
business O
investment O
. O

and O
our O
tax O
code O
should O
encourage O
investment O
. O

today O
a O
small O
business O
can O
deduct O
a O
maximum O
of O
$ O
25,000 O
in O
the O
year O
in O
which O
they O
buy O
equipment O
. O

we O
need O
to O
triple O
the O
amount O
that O
can O
be O
deducted O
in O
the O
year O
in O
which O
they O
buy O
equipment O
. O

[ O

so O
i O
propose O
to O

that O
they O
ought O
to O
limit O

limit O
ought O
to O
be O
increased O

75,000 O
and O
that O
limit O
ought O
to O
be O
indexed O
to O
inflation O
. O

by O
doing O
so O
, O
we O
promote O
greater O
investment O
in O
machinery O

and O
when O
a O

bias O
machine O
that O
enhances O
their O
company O

product O
divty O
as O
well O
as O
it O
means O
machinery O
manufacturer O
is O
likely O
to O
have O
more O
work O
available O
. O

more O
investment O
equals O
jobs O

and O
what O
we O
are O
interested O
in O
in O
this O
administration O
is O
helping O
people O
who O
look O
for O
work O
find O
a O
job O
. O

[ O
applause O
] O
we O
can O
also O
promote O
economic O
growth O
and O
job O
creation O
by O
removing O
the O
double O
tax O
on O
dividends O
. O

[ O
applause O

taxing O
corporate O

once O
is O
fair O
. O

it O
is O
not O
fair O
for O
the O
federal O
government O
to O
tax O
the O
same O
money O
twice O
. O

the O
burden O
of O
double O
taxation O
falls O
on O
the O
millions O
of O

receive O

falls O
especially O
hard O
on O
seniors O
who O
receive O
half O

all O
dividend O

. O

removal O
of O
double O
taxation O
would O
put O
more O
money O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
investors O
. O

it O
would O
encourage O
more O
investment O
in O
american B-LOC

this O

the O

now O

these O

the O

it O

caused O
our O

to O

the O
best O
way O
to O
reduce O

is O
with O

we O
need O

both O
60- O

82-millimeter O
mortars O

CLARK O
Well O
, O
they O
're O
very O
well O
equipped O

Definitely O
put O
up O
a O
fight O
. O

Rocket-propelled O
grenades O
. O

Been O
finding O
a O
lot O
of O
these O
lately O
. O

These O
could O
take O
out O
a O
Jeep O
or O
a O
Humvee O
in O
a O
heartbeat O
. O

CHILCOTE O
Now O
, O
is O
this O
a O

you O
said O
you O
'd O
seen O
a O
lot O
of O
weapons O
caches O
recently O
found O

CHILCOTE O
Is O
this O
a O
large O
cache O
? O

CLARK O
No O
, O
I O
'd O
say O
this O
is O
about O
a O
medium O
cache O

What O
... O
CHILCOTE O
This O
looks O
like O
a O
lot O
of O
weapons O
. O

CLARK O
It O
looks O
like O
a O
lot O
of O
weapons O
, O
but O
it O
's O
really O
not O
. O

This O
-- O
technically O
, O
this O
would O
probably O
would O
outfit O
a O
platoon O
, O
a O
platoon O
of O
( O
UNINTELLIGIBLE O
) O
. O

CHILCOTE O
OK. O
CLARK O
Keep O
going O
on O
. O

This O
is O
a O
little O
bit O
more O
advanced O
, O
these O
are O
25-millimeter O
shells O
, O
and O
each O
one O
of O
those O
silver O
boxes O
you O
see O
behind O
them O
hold O
50 O
of O
these O
shells O
. O

That O
's O
a O
little O
bit O
above O
us O

That's O
actually O
going O
into O
mechanized O
and O
armor O
. O

CHILCOTE O
All O
right O
. O

And O
you O
were O
talking O
about O
the O
makers O
, O
where O
some O
of O
these O
weapons O
are O
coming O
from O
, O
and O
you O
were O
expressing O
surprise O
to O
me O
. O

CLARK O
Roger O
. O

A O
majority O
of O
these O
are O
coming O
from O
-- O
( O
UNINTELLIGIBLE O
) O
on O
this O
box O
, O
but O
Jordan B-LOC
and O
France B-LOC
. O

We O
have O
a O
very O
scattered O
, O
limited O
, O
and O
Russian B-LOC
equipment O
, O
but O
like O
I O
said O
, O
France B-LOC
and O
Jordan B-LOC
are O
the O
main O
suppliers O
right O
here O
. O

CHILCOTE O
Now O
for O
your O
guys O
, O
this O
is O
dangerous O
work O
, O
finding O
... O
CLARK O
It O
's O
-- O
yes O
, O
it O
's O
extremely O
dangerous O
, O
because O
once O
you O
enter O
these O
buildings O
, O
we O
found O
, O
actually O
, O
enemy O
, O
you O
know O
, O
guarding O
these O
sites O

Do O
n't O
know O
if O
they O

Do O

know O
what O

what O

going O

there O

So O
it O

you O

how O

that O

all O
happening O

What O
are O
we O
seeing O
here O

MCCANN O
Just O
there O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
just O
getting O
the O
door O
out O
of O
the O
way O
, O
you O
can O
see O
where O
the O
weapons O
have O
to O
go O
. O

Now O
, O
you O
just O
see O
this O
soldier O
right O
here O
, O
he O
's O
going O
to O
his O
sidearm O
to O
make O
a O
little O
bit O
more O
mobile O
. O

And O
he O
's O
got O
to O
be O
careful O
of O
his O
muzzle O
pointing O
at O
his O
partner O
right O
here O
. O

Now O
, O
he's O
going O
to O
go O
that O
direction O
, O
because O
that O
room O
is O
clear O
. O

Go O
ahead O
and O
stop O
the O

you O
make O
every O
entry O
, O
Miles O
, O
there O
are O
two O
dead O

one O
, O
of O

, O
in O
this O

right O
here O
, O
which O
you O
ca O
n't O
see O
from O
the O
doorway O
, O
the O
other O
in O
this O
direction O
right O
here O
, O
and O
that O
's O
always O
the O
problem O
, O
because O
as O
you O
come O
in O
here O
, O
you O
've O
got O
to O
be O
able O
to O
get O
in O
there O
quickly O
and O
make O
sure O
that O
this O
person O
here O
does O
n't O
get O

in O
the O

So O
... O
O'BRIEN O
All O
right O

Now O

what O
about O
this O
, O
this O

? O

Tell O

how O
they O

there O

this O
is O

just O
for O

This O
will O
also O
stop O

And O
there O
's O
a O
difference O

The O
normal O
flak O
jacket O
will O
stop O
fragments O
from O

et O

This O
is O
a O
plate O
that O
will O
actually O
stop O
and O
deform O
a O
bullet O
. O

O'BRIEN O
All O
right O
. O

Let O
's O
roll O

and O
continue O
on O
here O
and O
talk O
about O

Now O
, O
I O
notice O
his O

he O

and O
you O
can O
see O
once O
that O

in O
case O
there O
's O
any O
sympathetic O

, O
there O
's O
no O
problem O
. O

You O
'll O
see O
another O
person O
come O
right O
up O
here O
, O
and O
he O
'll O
hold O
on O
this O
door O
, O
because O
that O

not O
been O
cleared O

yet O
, O
again O

we O
'll O
show O
you O
a O

more O

O'BRIEN O
All O
right O

Now O
, O
this O

could O

A O

You O

Bush O
Cabinet O
President O
Bush O

another O

and O
he O
has O
already O
started O
to O
appoint O

people O
to O
his O
political O
cabinet O
as O
current O

like O
Colin O

Who O
would O
you O
like O
to O

Who O
are O
they O

and O
why O

you O

A O

the O

the O

the O
guy O
that O
, O
um O
-- O
Tom O
Ridge O
just O
re- O
resigned O
yesterday O
. O

He O
was O
another O
one O
that O
was O
-- O
I O
did O
n't O
really O
know O
that O
much O
about O
him O
. O

I O
mean O
, O
I O
guess O
he O
was O
kind O
of O
the O
first O
-- O
one O
on O
that O
homeland O
security O
or O
, O
in O
charge O
of O
that O
. O

But O
I O
heard O
that O
they O
were O
going O
to O
-- O
one O
of O
the O
possible O
candidates O
is O
the O
the O
guy O
he O
used O
to O
be O
the O
chief O
of O
police O
of O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
. O

Well O
that O
's O
somebody O
to O
me O
that O
's O
going O
to O
have O
some O
good O
-- O
insight O
into O

you O
know O

what O
it O
takes O
you O
know O

to O
-- O
keep O

You O
know O
, O
because O
New B-LOC

, O
I O
don't O
know O
if O
you O
've O
ever O
been O
there O
B O
Yeah O
, O
I O
went O
there O
( O
( O
before O

) O
A O
has O
has O
has O
got O
some O
-- O
different O
rules O
from O
Texas B-LOC
as O
far O
as O
-- O
you O
know O
you O
know O
, O
running O
the O
city O

I O
mean O
I O
, O
there O
's O
a O
lot O
lot O
more O
people O
dense O
population O
up O
there O
than O
there O
is O
in O
in O
Texas B-LOC
and O
they O
probably O
would O
have O
uh O
the O
pol- O
uh O
the O
police O
chief O
would O
probably O
know O
-- O
well O
what O
can O
work O
in O
like O
, O
airports O
or O
, O
you O
know O
, O
things O
, O
situations O
like O
that O
. O

He O
was O
, O
he O
was O
a O
pretty O
good O
-- O
pretty O
smart O
person O
. O

But O
I O
, O
it O
did O
n't O
-- O
I O
ca O
n't O
remember O
his O
name O
, O
but O
-- O
the O
, O
I O
saw O
an O
interview O
with O
him O
, O
and O
-- O
how O
he O
, O
uh O
-- O
ran O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
and O
uh O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
some O
of O
the O
-- O
ru- O
you O
know O
, O
they O
changed O
some O
of O
the O
rules O
, O
uh O
-- O
uh O
, O
not O
rules O
, O
but O
the O
way O
they O
-- O
uh O
B O
The O
management O
team O
A O
protected O
the O
city O
. O

The O
the O
police O
kind O
of O
changed O
their O
tactics O
and O
, O
because O
there O
was O
a O
lot O
of O
-- O
oh O
-- O
run O
down O
areas O
, O
and O
a O
lot O
of O
crime O
and O
they O
, O
you O
know O
-- O
got O
-- O
cleaned O
it O
up O
, O
and O
and O
-- O
they O
passed O
some O
laws O
that O
said O
, O
you O
know O
, O
you O
could O
n't O
, O
I O
think O
it O
was O
like O
, O
um O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
like O
homeless O
people O
that O
-- O
carrying O
-- O
uh O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
shopping O
carts O
, O
or O
something O
like O
that O
, O
and O
it O
sounds O
-- O
small O
-- O
to O
outlaw O
that O
. O

But O
they O
outlawed O
that O
because O
they O
said O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
were O
stealing O
stuff O
. O

They O
'd O
stick O
them O
in O
the O
shopping O
carts O
and O
push O
them O
down O
the O
road O
. O

You O
would O
n't O
know O
, O
oh O
, O
they O
're O
just O
a O
homeless O
person O
. O

Well O
they O
cut O
that O
out O
and O
they O
found O
out O
-- O
it O
cut O
down O
on O
the O
theft O
. O

Uh O
-- O
I O
guess O
people O
-- O
hide O
them O
in O
their O
basket O
and O
-- O
or O
taking O
something O
and O
then O
stick O
in O
their O
basket O
and O
the O
police O
never O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
bothered O
them O
. O

Well O
, O
the O
homeless O
people O
-- O
I O
guess O
, O
they O
need O
their O
shopping O
cart O
, O
so O
they O
kind O
of O
went O
elsewhere O
, O
so O
-- O
um O
-- O
I O
mean O
it O
's O
a O
small O
thing O
, O
but O
it O
was O
, O
they O
just O
figured O
out O
, O
they O
were O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
uh O
-- O
learning O
from O
experience O
on O
what O
they O
need O
to O
do O
in O
the O
-- O
city O
and O
-- O
I O
think O
he O
would O
be O
a O
good O
-- O
candidate O
for O
the O
Homeland O
Security O
, O
running O
that O
. O

B O
But O
, O
eh O
, O
for O
the O
foreign O
po- O
uh O
this O
is O
all O
all O
what O
you O
are O
saying O
is O
like O
, O
about O
the O
internal O
-- O
but O
what O
about O
the O
external O
policy O
or O
something O
like O
that O
? O

Whom O
do O
you O

would O
be O

A O

what O

A O
Mhm O

B O
uh O
, O
whom O
do O
you O
think O
-- O
would O
be O
suitable O
for O
this O
position O
? O

A O
To O
run O
foreign O
policy O
? O

Um O
-- O
like O
, O
uh O
-- O
well O
, O
it O
was O
-- O
Colin O
Powell O
was O
Secretary O
, O
was O
he O
Secretary O
of O
State O
? O

Is O
that O
what O
that O
was O
? O

B O
Yeah O
. O

A O
And O
Condoleezza O
Rice O
is O
going O
to O
step O
into O
that O
position O
, O
the O
way O
I O
understand O
it O
, O
uh O
. O

B O
Yeah O
, O
that O
's O
right O
. O

A O
Yes O
. O

You O
know O
, O
she O
may O
be O
-- O
uh O
uh O
uh O
, O
you O
know O
, O
uh O
-- O
a O
uh O
Bush O
yes O
person O
, O
you O
know O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
uh O
B O
Yeah O
, O
so O
I O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
this O
will O
change O
too O
much O
I O
mean O
. O

A O
well O
mo- O
most O
-- O
most O
-- O
aides O
to O
the O
President O
, O
if O
it O
was O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
I O
guess O
when O
it O
was O
Clinton O
it O
was O
, O
they O
'd O
probably O
be O
kind O
of O
yes O
people O
too O
, O
but O
, O
I O
mean O
they O
pick O
the O
person O
to O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
help O
them O
and O
I O
guess O
they O
're O
going O
to O
have O
to O
have O
-- O
philosophies O
and O
and O
-- O
run O
it O
the O
way O
they O
would O
or O
way O
they O
'd O
want O
, O
uh O
B O
Yeah O
, O
actually O
I O
agree O
with O
you O
. O

I O
think O
uh O
-- O
during O
, O
uh O
, O
Clinton O
time O
uh O
-- O
the O
uh O
like O
international O
policy O
or O
the O
external O
policy O
was O
-- O
was O
much O
better O
than O
-- O
uh O
what O
what O
is O
happening O
right O
now O
, O
so O
. O

I O
think O
if O
we O
took O
Bill O
Clin- O
Bill O
Clinton O
as O
like O
, O
as O
a O
foreign O
policy O
-- O
He O
he O
would O
be O
he O
will O
do O
a O
very O
good O
job O
. O

I O
I O
would O
say O
. O

A O
Mhm O
. O

B O
Uh O
, O
do O
you O
think O
there O
is O
uh O
-- O
some O
other O
, O
uh O
like O

has O
to O
be O
has O
been O
-- O
has O
to O
be O
created O
, O
like O
uh O
-- O
for O
the O
next O

. O

A O
I O
'm O
s- O
-- O
say O
that O
again O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
understand O
. O

B O
I O
mean O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
is O
there O
any O
other O
, O
eh O
, O
positions O
or O
-- O
Uh O
, O
like O
uh O
, O
has O
to O
be O
created O
like O
the O
-- O
uh O
-- O
election O
. O

I O
mean O
-- O
uh O
, O
for O
example O
they O
they O
made O
, O
uh O
-- O
a O
position O
for O
like O
, O
uh O
-- O

eh O
, O

-- O
I O
I O
think O
after O
, O
eh O
September O
eleventh O
A O
Mhm O
. O

B O
they O
created O
a O
position O
like O
that O
. O

Do O
you O

there O
is O
-- O
some O
other O
position O
has O
eh O
have O
to O
be O

Sara O
Hi O
, O
this O
is O
Sara O
, O
from O
California B-LOC
. O

Suzanne O
Hi O
. O

Sara O
Hey O
. O

Suzanne O
So O
who O
do O
you O
think O
should O
run O
? O

Sara O
uh O
-- O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

I O
was O
going O
to O
say O
, O
that O
's O
quite O
the O
topic O
. O

um O
-- O
I O
have O
n't O
thought O
about O
it O
much O
. O

I O
know O
my O
husband O
said O
he O
thinks O
-- O
that O
uh O
-- O
Colin O
Powell O
should O
-- O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
he O
will O
. O

Suzanne O
I O
I O
do O
n't O
he O
think O
will O
either O
, O
because O
he O
turned O
it O
down O
in O
two O
thousand O
and O
four O
. O

Sara O
Right O
, O
and O
Suzanne O
Sorry O
, O
two O
thousand O
and O
-- O
two O
thousand O
. O

Sara O
Two O
thousand O
, O
yeah O
, O
the O
one O
before O
that O
. O

Suzanne O
Yeah O
. O

Sara O
Yeah O
. O

uh O
-- O
I O
'm O
not O
very O
fond O
of O
Hillary O
Clinton O
, O
so O
I O
-- O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
I O
'd O
go O
for O
her O
, O
but O
-- O
but O
uh O
what O
do O
you O
think O
? O

Suzanne O
um O
-- O
I O
am O
reluctant O
to O
see O
another O
Bush O
brother O
on O
the O
ticket O
for O
the O
Republicans B-ORG
Sara O
Mhm O
. O

Suzanne O
but O
I O
think O
that O
putting O
Jeb O
Bush O
would O
make O
h- O
-- O
the O
Republican B-ORG
ticket O
easier O
to O
defeat O
. O

Sara O
Mhm O
. O

Suzanne O
um O
-- O
I O
really O
do O
n't O
think O
that O
Hillary O
Clinton O
-- O
would O
be O
-- O
a O
good O
choice O
for O
the O
Democrats B-ORG
. O

Sara O
Yeah O
. O

Suzanne O
um O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
Barak O
Obama O
would O
be O
a O
very O
good O
choice O
for O
the O
Democrats B-ORG
. O

Sara O
Uh-huh O
. O

Suzanne O
Just O
because O
he O
's O
-- O
he O
's O
really O
young O
, O
and O
he O
's O
going O
to O
be O
starting O
off O
his O
career O
. O

Sara O
Uh-huh O
. O

Suzanne O
um O
I O
would O
almost O
like O
to O
see O
John O
Edwards O
on O
the O
ticket O
again O
. O

Sara O
Uh-huh O
. O

Yeah O
. O

uh O
Yeah O
. O

Did O
they O
ever O
do O
that O
one O
? O

That O
's O
n- O
the- O
that O
's O
happened O
before O
, O
has O
n't O
it O
, O
where O
someone O
who O
-- O
who O
was O
defeated O
ran O
again O
? O

Suzanne O
Yeah O
. O

Sara O
They O
do O
n't O
do O
it O
very O
often O
, O
probably O
just O
because O
they O
figure O
if O
he O
lost O
once O
, O
he'll O
Suzanne O
Well O
I O
I O
think O
he O
's O
a O
really O
good O
candidate O
, O
and O
four O
more O
years O
could O
really O
help O
him O
develop O
his O
um O
-- O
could O
help O
him O
develop O
-- O
hi- O
his O
voting O
record O
especially O
. O

Sara O
Right O
. O

Suzanne O
And O
I O
think O
that O
would O
help O
the O
Democratic B-ORG
ticket O
a O
lot O
. O

Sara O
Right O
, O
because O
that O
's O
something O
he O
got O
-- O
kind O
of O
-- O
uh O
-- O
got O
brought O
up O
a O
lot O
. O

Suzanne O
Yeah O
. O

Sara O
Hm O
. O

Well O
, O
they O
-- O
let O
's O
see O
. O

Suzanne O
I O
mean O
, O
I O
'd O
like O
to O
s- O
-- O
I O
'd O
like O
to O
see O
the O
Greens B-ORG
run O
David O
Cobb O
again O
. O

Sara O
Uh-huh O
. O

uh O
See O
, O
hav- O
I O
have O
n't O
paid O
much O
attention O
to O
them O
, O
I O
-- O
I O
kind O
of O
looked O
at O
the O
-- O
the O
other O
listed O
candidates O
-- O
but O
I O
figure O
-- O
they O
d- O
-- O
they O
d- O
none O
of O
them O
had O
enough O
support O
to O
get O
close O
, O
so O
Suzanne O
Yeah O
. O

Sara O
um O
-- O
trying O
to O
think O
who O
else O
-- O
Arnold O
Schwarzenegger O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
-- O
well O
he O
's O
not O
qualified O
anyway O
, O
but O
Suzanne O
Well O
, O
they O
might O
change O
something O
, O
you O
know O
, O
between O
now O
and O
then O
. O

Sara O
I O
've O
heard O
people O
say O
that O
would O
take O
a O
-- O
I O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
they O
will O
. O

uh O
That O
takes O
a O
Constitutional O
amendment O
. O

That O
's O
pretty O
hard O
to O
-- O
to O
get O
through O
. O

Suzanne O
Well O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
you O
live O
in O
California B-LOC
. O

How O
is O
he O
doing O
-- O
in O
your O
state O
? O

Sara O
Oh O
, O
I O
think O
he O
's O
done O
all O
right O
, O
um O
-- O
I O
I O
-- O
He O
's O
a O
he O
's O
a O
moderate O
Republican O
, O
you O
know O
, O
he O
's O
not O
Suzanne O
Right O
. O

Sara O
he O
's O
not O
uh O
-- O
hard O
core O
Republican O
, O
so O
he O
works O
pretty O
well O
with O
-- O
since O
this O
is O
this O
is O
mostly O
a O
Democratic B-ORG
State O
. O

He O
does O
pretty O
well O
. O

Suzanne O
um O
-- O
They O
've O
been O
talking O
about O
getting O
the O
Canadian-born B-LOC

of O
I O
think O
Minnesota B-LOC
Sara O
Mhm O
. O

Suzanne O
to O
run O

Suzanne O
Well O
, O
Geraldine O
Ferraro O

first O
woman O
for O
a O
major O
party O

. O

Suzanne O
as O
Vice O
President O
-- O
for O
the O
Democrats B-ORG
, O
I O
believe O
Sara O

Suzanne O

eighties O
. O

Sara O
Right O
. O

Suzanne O
But O

Yeah O

It O
's O
got O
to O
happen O
at O
some O
point O

Because O
Elizabeth O

did O
n't O
make O
it O
too O
well O

going O
to O
be O
the O
-- O
was O
she O
going O

was O
g- O
actually O
going O
for O

herself O
. O

Sara O
candidate O
? O

She O
was O
actually O
going O
for O
President O

Suzanne O
I O
'd O
like O
to O

Sara O
Uh-huh O

I O
Suzanne O
And O
she O

too O
hard-core O
Republican B-ORG

I O
do O

This O
-- O
This O
uh O
-- O
last O
election O
being O
just O
over O

I O
had O
n't O
really O
started O
thinking O
much O
about O
the O
next O
one O
. O

Suzanne O
Right O
. O

Do O
you O
think O
any O
of O
the O
s- O
any O
other O

really O
good O
chance O

if O

really O
surprised O

to O
see O
him O
win O
, O
but O

Question O
regarding O
simple O
assault O
& O
amp O
; O
battery O
My O
roommate O
was O
hospitalized O
in O
mid-November O
for O
lung O
surgery O
and O
spent O
several O
days O
on O
loads O
of O
pain O
medication O
. O

On O
the O
fourth O
day O
of O
his O
stay O
, O
he O
was O
moved O
out O
of O
the O
ICU O
to O
the O
step-down O
unit O
, O
with O
a O
diagnosis O
of O
`` O
ICU O
Psychosis O
secondary O
to O
narcotic O
administration O
'' O
and O
post O
thoracostomy O
. O
'' O

He O
was O
confused O
, O
because O
of O
the O
medication O
but O
was O
not O
aggressive O
or O
threatening O
in O
any O
manner O
. O

I O
saw O
him O
each O
day O
and O
as O
soon O
as O
we O
spoke O
, O
he O
became O
oriented O
and O
was O
perfectly O
fine O
. O

This O
was O
witnessed O
by O
both O
the O
nursing O
staff O
and O
his O
doctors O
. O

During O
the O
early O
evening O
hours O
of O
his O
sixth O
hospital O
day O
, O
he O
got O
up O
, O
dressed O
, O
pulled O
his O
chest O
tube O
out O
and O
managed O
to O
get O
out O
of O
the O
hospital O
and O
across O
four O
lanes O
of O
busy O
evening O
traffic O
, O
to O
our O
apartment O
. O

By O
the O
time O
he O
got O
to O
our O
home O
, O
he O
was O
very O
short O
of O
breath O
and O
there O
was O
a O
nurse O
and O
orderly O
who O
told O
me O
`` O
he O
's O
crazy O
and O
just O
walked O
out O
. O
'' O

I O
sat O
him O
down O
on O
the O
couch O
and O
talked O
to O
him O
, O
and O
asked O
him O
what O
had O
happened O
. O

He O
said O
he O
'd O
asked O
for O
something O
for O
pain O
and O
they O
told O
hime O
he O
could O
n't O
have O
anything O
. O

Then O
the O
orderly O
was O
apparently O
rude O
to O
him O
, O
and O
that O
's O
when O
he O
got O
up O
and O
decided O
to O
come O
home O
. O

A O
short O
time O
later O
, O
two O
police O
officers O
showed O
up O
and O
told O
me O
they O
had O
to O
take O
him O
back O
to O
the O
hospital O
. O

He O
went O
back O
with O
the O
officers O
, O
gave O
them O
no O
problems O
at O
all O
. O

I O
received O
a O
call O
from O
the O
shift O
supervisor O
who O
told O
me O
they O
'd O
replaced O
his O
chest O
tube O
, O
given O
him O
some O
pain O
medication O
and O
he O
was O
doing O
much O
better O
. O

I O
told O
her O
to O
pass O
on O
the O
other O
shifts O
that O
if O
he O
became O
confused O
or O
upset O
to O
call O
me O
, O
and O
I O
'd O
talk O
to O
him O
, O
and O
get O
him O
settled O
down O
. O

At O
2:15 O
the O
next O
morning O
, O
I O
received O
a O
call O
from O
the O
night O
shift O
supervisor O
who O
told O
me O
my O
friend O
had O
been O
`` O
verbally O
abusive O
and O
aggressive O
'' O
and O
would O
I O
come O
over O
and O
talk O
to O
him O
. O

So O
, O
I O
went O
over O
there O
, O
getting O
to O
his O
room O
right O
at O
2:30 O
. O

There O
were O
two O
cops O
there O
and O
I O
asked O
what O
had O
happened O
. O

My O
roommate O
was O
in O
bed O
, O
sound O
asleep O
, O
and O
had O
all O
of O
his O
clothes O
on O
. O

A O
nurse O
said O
, O
`` O
He O
beat O
two O
of O
us O
up O
. O

The O
cops O
are O
here O
because O
we O
're O
pressing O
charges O
. O
'' O

I O
've O
lived O
with O
this O
man O
9 O
years O
and O
never O
in O
that O
time O
have O
I O
ever O
seen O
him O
be O
aggressive O
, O
violent O
or O
abusive O
in O
anyway O
. O

I O
asked O
to O
speak O
to O
the O
two O
nurses O
whom O
he O
'd O
alledgedly O
hit O
and O
was O
told O
I O
could O
n't O
do O
that O
. O

An O
hour O
or O
so O
passed O
and O
the O
got O
my O
roommate O
out O
of O
bed O
, O
took O
his O
chest O
tube O
out O
and O
discharged O
him O
. O

He O
was O
sent O
to O
another O
hospital O
with O
a O
psych O
unit O
until O
his O
psychosis O
resolved O
. O

I O
was O
given O
copies O
of O
a O
citation O
for O
simple O
assault O
and O
battery O
, O
then O
went O
to O
the O
police O
station O
several O
days O
later O
to O
find O
out O
what O
other O
paperwork O
was O
available O
on O
this O
incident O
. O

I O
was O
given O
a O
copy O
of O
a O
different O
citation O
, O
but O
with O
the O
identical O
information O
from O
the O
one O
I'd O
gotten O
the O
night O
of O
the O
incident O
. O

The O
police O
report O
has O
the O
victim O
saying O
she O
was O
`` O
choked O
to O
where O
she O
almost O
lost O
consciousness O
, O
struck O
in O
the O
face O
with O
a O
belt O
buckle O
and O
it O
had O
left O
large O
marks O
, O
and O
that O
he O
'd O
grabbed O
her O
breasts O
and O
left O
marks O
. O

According O
to O
the O
police O
report O
, O
this O
woman O
never O
reported O
to O
the O
ER O
for O
verification O
of O
the O
injuries O
and O
no O
one O
else O
can O
verify O
exactly O
what O
happened O
to O
provoke O
this O
incident O
. O

My O
roommate O
has O
no O
recollection O
of O
the O
time O
from O
the O
day O
before O
the O
incident O
happened O
until O
he O
woke O
up O
at O
the O
other O
hospital O
. O

He O
was O
cited O
for O
simple O
assault O
and O
battery O
. O

If O
there O
is O
no O
evidence O
, O
and O
that O
includes O
the O
belt O
buckle O
, O
how O
can O
the O
county O
prosecute O
this O
case O
. O
? O

All O
of O
his O
belongings O
were O
returned O
to O
me O
upon O
his O
discharge O
, O
with O
the O
exception O
of O
the O
belt O
buckle O
. O

The O
police O
do O
not O
have O
it O
and O
the O
hospital O
does O
n't O
know O
what O
happened O
to O
it O
. O

Also O
, O
I O
was O
looking O
at O
both O
citations O
, O
I O
did O
n't O
get O
to O
the O
hospital O
until O
2:30 O
am O
, O
and O
the O
officer O
has O
the O
time O
of O
incident O
as O
being O
at O
2:34 O
am O
. O

Does O
anyone O
besides O
me O
see O
a O
problem O
with O
any O
of O
this O
? O

What O
kind O
of O
recourse O
does O
my O
roommate O
have O
in O
all O
of O
this O
? O

You O

In O

I O

raising O
the O

The O
hospital O
obviously O
knew O
that O
your O
friend O
was O
having O
head O
problems O
, O
and O
they O
improperly O
treated O
him O
by O
not O
sending O
him O
to O
a O
psych O
ward O
, O
which O
allowed O
the O
situation O
to O
get O
worse O
until O
the O
point O
where O
he O
assaulted O
someone O
. O

Sue O
them O
for O
malpractice O
, O
and O
make O
the O
number O
big O
enough O
to O
get O
some O
serious O
attention O

So O
, O
uh O
, O
it O

not O
particularly O
special O
at O
Christmas O

because O
they O
see O
each O
other O
every O

, O
still O
, O
uh O
, O
they O
go O

Deirdre O
Well O

they O
seem O

I- O
I- O

, O
it's- O
it O

not- O
-- O
it O
's O
not O
special O
to O
me O
because O
they O
do O
it O
all O
the O
time O
. O

You O
know O
, O
special O
would O
make O
it O
, O
I O
only O
see O
you O
once O
a O
year O
. O

It O
's O
just O
not- O
it O
's O
just O
not O
special O
if O
I O
see O

. O

Ryan O
Yeah O

Deirdre O
You O
know O
, O

you- O
you O
might- O
you O
may O

your O

we O

spend O

not O

you O
just O
go O

eat O
dinner O
a O
couple O
of O
hours O
and O
go O
home O
. O

You O
go O
and O
you O
stay O
twelve O

I'm O
always O
asking O
her O
how O
my O
other O

are O
doing O
and O
-- O
she O
hardly O
knows O
because O
she O
has- O
hardly O
sees O
them O
every O
day O
. O

Deirdre O
Oh O
. O

Ryan O
So O

Gandhi O

Marco O
Uh O
, O
Marco O
from O
Illinois B-LOC
. O

Gandhi O
Okay O
, O
Mark O
. O

Uh O
, O
I O
think O
it O
's O
fresh O
topic O
for O
tonight O
. O

Marco O
Yeah O
, O
yeah O
. O

Good O
topic O
. O

It O
's O
a O
good O
topic O
. O

Gandhi O
So O
what O
do O
you O
think O
? O

Marco O
Well O
, O
um O
, O
I O
would- O
I O
would O
have O
to O
start- O
-- O
I O
would O
have O
to O
start O
, O
generally O
, O
in O
stating- O
-- O
stating O
what O
I O
think O
is O
the O
problem O
and O
-- O
-with O
the O
Middle B-LOC
East I-LOC
and O
what- O
For O
me O
, O
one O
of O
the O
major O
problems O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
-- O
the O
-- O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
government O
gives O
so O
much O
aid O
to O
the O
state O
of O
Israel B-LOC
. O

In O
which O
, O
the O
state O
of O
Israel B-LOC
buys O
-- O
many O
expensive O
military O
weapons O
, O
ah O
, O
which O
is O
used O
to O
-- O
oppress O
and O
-- O
to O
kill O
a O
lot O
of O
Palestinians O
. O

So O
, O
for O
me O
, O
that O
's O
-- O
the- O
that O
's O
essentially O
the O
root O
of O
the O
problem O
. O

And O
, O
um O
, O
Yasser O
Arafat O
was O
kind O
of O
in O
a O
difficult O
position O
, O
because O
you O
have O
these O
, O
um O
, O
incredibly O
-- O
oppressed O
and O
in O
some O
ways O
imprisoned O
, O
uh O
, O
Palestinians O
, O
and O
if O
-- O
Arafat O
had O
n't O
, O
um O
, O
tried O
to O
stand O
up O
-- O
and O
help O
them O
and- O
and O
fight O
for O
their O
rights O
, O
then O
-- O
m- O
they O
would O
n't O
have O
respected O
Arafat O
, O
but O
then O
again O
, O
you O
know O
, O
he O
could O
n't O
be O
too O
friendly O
with O
the O
West B-LOC
, O
um O
, O
and O
, O
um O
, O
and O
so O
he O
did O
the O
best O
he O
could O
, O
I O
think O
. O

It O
's O
a O
difficult O
-- O
leadership O
role O
. O

Gandhi O
Mhm O
. O

Marco O
Yeah O
. O

Um O
, O
what O
do- O
Well O
, O
how O
about O
you O
? O

Gandhi O
I O
think O
, O
yeah O
, O
more O
or O
less O
, O
I O
c- O
I O
agree O
with O
what O
you O
said O
. O

It's O
almost O
, O
this O
is O
my O
view O
as O
well O
. O

And O
the O
question O
is O
, O
what O
next O
? O

I O
mean O
, O
some O
idea O
-- O
from O
Israeli B-LOC
side O
, O
they O
were O
saying O
-- O
he O
was O
a O
problem O
, O
and O
if O
he O
goes O
, O
everything O
will O
be O
quite O
easy O
. O

Marco O
Yeah O
. O

Gandhi O
Fine O
. O

Now O
he O
's O
not O
in O
anymore O
. O

Marco O
Yeah O
. O

Gandhi O
So O
, O
let O
us O
wait O
and O
see O
. O

Hope O
. O

If O
he O
was O
a O
problem O
himself O
, O
hope O
-uh O
, O
the O
coming O
one O
-- O
will O
be O
in O
a O
good O
-- O
position O
to O
negotiate O
with O
the O
other O
side O
, O
Israel B-LOC
, O
and O
then O
-- O
peace O
can O
be O
achieved O
. O

Marco O
Yeah O
. O

Gandhi O
Uh O
, O
we O
have O
to O
wait O
and O
see O
, O
but O
, O
uh O
, O
it O
seems O
it O
's O
not O
easy O
. O

Marco O
But O
, O
I O
, O
eh O
, O
I O
get O
the O
feeling O
that- O
-- O
It O
's O
almost- O
-- O
The O
peace O
process- O
We O
ca O
n't O
put O
it O
on O
-- O
the O
ro- O
or O
the- O
-- O
the O
whole O
responsibility O
of O
the O
pre- O
-- O
peace O
process O
ca O
n't O
be O
the O
leader O
of O
-- O
a- O
-- O
a O
group O
that O
is- O
-- O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
in O
my O
view O
, O
has O
-- O
not O
ver- O
not O
very O
many O
resources O
to O
fight- O
-- O
to O
fight O
this O
-- O
battle O
that O
-- O
their O
trying O
to O
fight O
against O
-- O
a O
government O
that O
has O
taken O
away O
a O
lot O
of O
their O
land O
, O
that O
, O
you O
know O
, O
does O
n't O
allow O
them O
to O
really O
move O
around O
in O
their O
own O
country O
. O

So O
, O
unless O
that O
-- O
stops O
, O
the O
, O
um O
, O
the O
leader O
of O
the O
Palestinians O
-- O
really O
ca O
n't O
do O
too O
much O
-- O
to O
further O
the O
peace O
process O
, O
because O
-- O
there O
are O
-- O
a O
lot O
of O
bad O
things O
happening O
to O
the O
people O
-- O
of O
that O
-- O
leader O
. O

Gandhi O
That O
's O
correct O
, O
as O
well O
. O

Marco O
Yeah O
, O
so O
it's- O
-- O
it O
's O
kind O
of O
, O
it's- O
-- O
it O
seems O
like O
the O
, O
um O
, O
the O
media O
, O
at O
least O
in O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
, O
is O
-- O
putting O
all O
of O
this O
-- O
focus O
and O
responsibility O
on O
the O
leader O
of O
the O
Palestinians O
, O
as O
if O
it O
was O
Gandhi O
Marco O
Arafat O
's O
fault O
that O
any O
of- O
-- O
any O
of O
the O
violence O
was O
caused O
. O

So O
, O
it O
seems O
like O
an O
unfair O
treatment O
-- O
of- O
-- O
of O
, O
you O
know O
, O
the O
leader O
of O
-- O
the O
Palestinian B-LOC
people O
. O

Um O
, O
yeah O
. O

Gandhi O
Yes O
. O

That O
's O
absolutely O
correct O
. O

Yeah O
. O

Marco O
Yeah O
. O

Hm O
. O

Gandhi O
Actually O
, O
it- O
it O
's O
a O
good O
topic O
to O
be O
choosing O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
uh O
, O
because O
it O
's O
one O
of O
the O
fresh O
topics O
. O

Marco O
Yeah O
. O

Gandhi O
How O
long O
have O
you O

John O
A O
For O
my O
holiday O
post O
, O
I O
offer O
a O
message O
of O
hope O
for O
the O
business O
world O
. O

In O
1994 O
, O
I O
was O
a O
graduate O
student O
in O
Boston B-LOC
. O

I O
was O
asked O
to O
moderate O
a O
panel O
discussion O
on O
social O
entrepreneurship O
for O
a O
conference O
at O
Harvard B-ORG
Business O
School B-ORG
. O

The O
conference O
was O
being O
held O
by O
a O
new O
group O
called O
Students B-ORG
for O
Responsible O
Business B-ORG
. O

I O
expected O
to O
see O
a O
small O
gathering O
of O
idealistic O
, O
slightly O
naive O
MBA O
students O
. O

What O
I O
found O
was O
a O
packed O
room O
of O
200 O
intelligent O
, O
practical O
, O
driven O
idealists O
. O

These O
students O
were O
determined O
to O
figure O
out O
how O
to O
use O
business O
as O
a O
driver O
for O
positive O
social O
change O
. O

I O
left O
that O
room O
with O
my O
eyes O
open O
to O
the O
possibilities O
presented O
by O
these O
future O
business O

In O
2004 O

to O

by O
The O
University B-ORG

Texas B-ORG
McCombs I-ORG

Approximately O
900 O
people O
attended O
the O
2004 O

The O
buzz O
words O

the O

included O
social O
entrepreneurship O

working O
with O

I O
met O
student O
after O
student O
intent O
on O
harnessing O
the O
forces O
of O
business O
and O
capitalism O
to O
improve O
the O
world O
. O

These O
students O
understand O
that O
business O
is O
a O
powerful O
lever O
of O
change O
in O
this O
world O
. O

Recently O
business O
schools O
have O
received O
their O
share O
of O
criticism O
for O
turning O
out O
graduates O
who O
seem O
to O
have O
lost O
sight O
of O
their O
responsibility O
for O
ethical O
action O
. O

I O
can O
tell O
you O
that O
I O
am O
seeing O
a O
powerful O
groundswell O
of O
change O
coming O
from O
within O
business O
schools O
. O

It O
is O
not O
coming O
from O
the O
faculty O
, O
or O
the O
alumni O
, O
or O
the O
administration O
. O

All O
these O
groups O
continue O
to O
pay O
lipservice O
to O
topics O
of O
social O
responsibility O
while O
avoiding O
any O
real O
innovations O
in O
the O
student O
experiences O
. O

The O
change O
is O
being O
demanded O
by O
the O
students O
. O

A O
little O
secret O
of O
business O
schools O
is O
that O
MBA O
students O
have O
an O
immense O
amount O
of O
sway O
. O

Few O
choose O
to O
use O
it O
, O
but O
if O
they O
want O
they O
can O
fundamentally O
change O
their O
school O
. O

Right O
now O
students O
at O
business O
schools O
are O
asking O
for O
more O
discussion O
of O
these O
topics O
in O
classes O
, O
are O
initiating O
service O
projects O

no O

we O
will O
see O
the O
vast O

I O
often O
feel O
that O
we O
have O
conveniently O
forgotten O
his O

he O
defined O

a O
Palestinian B-LOC

a O

of O
the O

40 O

Barghouti O
was O
one O
of O
the O
major O
leaders O
of O
the O
First O
Intifada O
in O
1987 O
, O
leading O
Palestinians O
in O
a O
mass O
uprising O
against O
Israeli B-LOC
occupation O
of O
the O
West B-LOC
Bank I-LOC

During O
the O
uprising O
, O
he O
was O
arrested O
by O
Israel B-LOC
and O
deported O
to O
Jordan B-LOC
, O
where O
he O
stayed O
for O
seven O
years O
until O
he O
was O
permitted O
to O
return O
under O
the O
terms O
of O
the O
Oslo B-LOC
Accords O
in O
1994 O
. O

In O
1996 O
, O
he O
was O
elected O
to O
the O
Palestinian B-ORG
Legislative O
Council B-ORG
, O
in O
which O
he O
advocated O
peace O
with O
Israel B-LOC
, O
sometimes O
coming O
in O
conflict O
with O
Yasser O
Arafat O

The O
formal O
position O
occupied O
by O
Barghouti O
was O
the O
General O
Secretary O
of O
Fatah B-ORG
in O
the O
West B-LOC
Bank I-LOC

By O
the O
summer O
of O
2000 O
, O
Barghouti O
and O
Arafat O
had O
grown O
increasingly O
at O
odds O
with O
each O
other O
, O
with O
Barghouti O
accusing O
Arafat O
's O
administration O
of O
corruption O
and O
his O
security O
services O
of O
human O
rights O
violations O
, O
and O
Arafat O
was O
planning O
to O
fire O
him O
shortly O
. O

However O
, O
as O
the O
Second O

, O
Barghouti O
became O
increasingly O
popular O
as O
a O
leader O
of O
the O
Fatah B-ORG
Tanzim O
militia B-ORG

This O
was O
perhaps O
due O
to O
the O
transformation O
of O
Tanzim B-ORG
into O
an O
organization O
more O
resembling O

it O
killed O
her O
, O

I O
you O

I O

I O

Rudy O
Giuliani O
was O
a O
great O
mayor O

for O
nine O
eleven O
. O

A O
Right O
. O

B O
I O
do O

he O
was O
a O
great O
mayor O
the O
whole O
time O
he O
was O
a O
mayor O
. O

A O
Well O
, O
I O
I O
'm O
a O
New O
Yorker O
, O
and O
I O
got O
to O
tell O
you O
that O
I O
I O
think O
nine O
eleven O
I O
I O
think O
-- O
basically O
made O
him O
. O

Other O
than O
that O
, O
I O
think O
he O
was O
a O
little O
too O
decisive O
. O

B O
Yeah O
. O

A O
Uh O
not O
I O
should O
n't O
say O
decisive O
, O
too O
divisive O
. O

B O
Yeah O
, O
I O
think O
he O
A O
As O
far O
as O
-- O
the O
race O
relationship O
in O
this O
city O
. O

You O
know O
, O
it O
doesn't O
take O
much O
to O
to O
please O
-- O
the O
other O
side O
. O

And O
that O
and O
that O
's O
what O
government O
is O
all O
about O
. O

B O
no O
, O
it O
does O
n't O
. O

A O
And O
he O
-- O
he O
was O
n't O
-- O
he O
was O
n't O
too O
much O
of O
a O
good O
uh O
B O
He O
he O
would O
've O
gone O
out O
as O
a O
mediocre O
mayor O
had O
it O
not O
. O

And O
I O
but O
even O
even O
saying O
that O
I O
ca O
n't O
begrudge O
him O
. O

But O
he O
did O
a O
great O
job O
in O
the O
crisis O
. O

Some O
people O
do O
better O
in O
crises O
. O

A O
Yeah O
. O

Exactly O
. O

Exactly O
, O
exactly O
, O
I O
I O
think O
that O
nine O
eleven O
made O
him O
and O
B O
Yeah O
. O

A O
and O
at O
that O
point O
in O
time O
, O
he O
wanted O
to O
stay O
on O
, O
which O
was O
sort O
of O
sort O
of O
ridiculous O
. O

B O
And O
if O
if O
if O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
country O
knows O
that O
, O
because O
they O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
he O
did O
before O
nine O
eleven O
, O
because O
they O
do O
n't O
pay O
any O
attention O
. O

A O
Eh O
-- O
Exactly O
. O

Exactly O
, O
of O
course O
, O
you O
're O
right O
, O
you O
're O
quite O
right O
. O

B O
And O
-- O
I O
think O
that O
if O
he O
did O
get O
a O
government O
agency O
, O
it O
would O
have O
to O
be O
one O
that O
was O
having O
crisis O
a O
lot O
of O
times O
I O
mean O
, O
he O
would O
just O
have O
to O
devote O
himself O
to O
that O
. O

If O
he O
could O
just O
do O
that O
, O
it O
would O
be O
fine O
. O

A O
It O
's O
a O
good O
point O
. O

B O
But O
if O
he O
gets O
if O
gets O
into O
a O
lot O
of O
policy O
making O
and O
stuff O
that O
for O
other O
things O
, O
you O
know O
, O
A O
Yeah O
, O
yeah O
. O

Yeah O
, O
I O
I O
I O
I O
know O
I O
one O
of O
the O
B O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

Probably O
would O
be O
a O
good O
attorney O
general O
, O
he O
did O
that O
A O
it O
could O
very O
well O
, O
he O
did O
a O
good O
job O
, O
you O
're O
right O
, O
he O
probably O
could O
follow O
in O
what O
's O
his O
name O
's O
footsteps O
. O

B O
you O
know O
. O

I O
think O
I O
think O
the O
cases O
that O
he O
picks O
and O
chooses O
probably O
I O
would O
n't O
necessarily O
put O
on O
top O
of O
the O
list O
, O
but O
he O
did O
seem O
to O
A O
Right O
. O

B O
prosecute O
everybody O
evenly O
. O

A O
Yeah O
. O

That O
much O
I O
think O
we O
can O
we O
can O
probably O
agree O
with O
. O

He O
will O
probably O
do O
that O
evenly O
. O

B O
Yes O
. O

Right O
. O

A O
I O
you O
know O
who O
I O

I O

I O

I O

you O
've O
got O
to O
be O
kidding O
me O

B O
Yeah O
. O

A O
But O
uh O
-- O
I O
thought O
he O
would O
have O
made O
a O

for O
himself O

um O
-- O
I O
I O
ca O
n't O
think O

anyone O
anyone O
that O
anyone O
else O
out O

that O
um O

that O

I O

, O
you O
know O
, O
you O
just O
B O
No O
. O

A O
pick O
people O
who O
I O

have O
the O

not O
in O

not O

in O

put O

B O
Well O
, O
Yeah O
, O
I O
think O
uh O
-- O
apparently O
-- O
the O
President O
likes O
people O
that O
are O
the O
same O
philo- O
-- O
political O
philosophy O
as O
him O
, O
and O
I O
'm O
not O
sure O
I O
mean O
I O
think O
he O
just O
needs O
some O
other O
voices O
in O

A O
That O
's O

B O

If O

when O

it O

an O

good O

you O

you O
. O

it O
was O
only O
about O
30 O
years O
ago O
when O
we O
went O
to O
the O
moon O
. O

so O
what O
's O
the O
difficulty O
in O
being O
able O
to O
go O
to O
mars B-LOC
? O

it O
's O
unimaginably O
difficult O
and O
different O
. O

mars B-LOC
is O
at O
most O
times O
100 O
million O
miles O
away O
from O
us O
. O

it O
's O
a O
nine-month O
trip O
. O

then O
if O
we O
stay O
there O
for O
about O
a O
year O
or O
two O
, O
the O
whole O
trip O
could O
last O
about O
three O
years O
. O

we O
're O
talking O
about O
conditions O
where O
there O
's O
radiation O
in O
space O
cosmic O
radiation O
that O
could O
cause O
cancer O
. O

the O
communications O
conditions O
once O
you O
're O
on O
mars B-LOC
, O
just O
to O
talk O
to O
people O
on O
earth B-LOC
, O
there O
's O
a O
20 O
minute O
delay O
in O
the O
conversation O
. O

so O
the O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
the O
issues O
are O
so O
much O
larger O
than O
going O
to O
the O
moon O
. O

and O
for O
now O
, O
it O
's O
250 O
days O
, O
which O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
maximum O
for O
astronauts O
in O
space O
anyway O
. O

but O
as O
you O
say O
, O
it O
's O
a O
much O
further O
travel O
. O

but O
let O
's O
talk O
about O
some O
of O
the O
hurdles O
that O
hamper O
humans O
to O
be O
able O
to O
survive O
there O
. O

the O
dust O
, O
for O
one O
thing O
. O

cataracts O
another O
. O

let O
's O
talk O
about O
the O
right O
kind O
of O
spacecraft O
that O
would O
be O
able O
to O
allow O
humans O
to O
actually O
get O
that O
far O
and O
to O
survive O
. O

right O
. O

well O
, O
first O
of O
all O
, O
the O
spacecraft O
would O
not O
be O
launched O
from O
earth B-LOC
. O

you O
'd O
have O
to O
launch O
is O
from O
in O
space O
already O
, O
which O
means O
we O
would O
have O
to O
build O
it O
in O
space O
. O

so O
that O
means O
we O
need O
a O
good O
shuttle O
that O
's O
going O
to O
take O
us O
back O
and O
forth O
to O
build O
the O
spacecraft O
. O

then O
we O
have O
to O
come O
up O
with O
the O
fuel O
that O
will O
take O
it O
out O
of O
the O
earth's B-LOC
orbit O
all O
the O
way O
to O
mars B-LOC
. O

that O
's O
probably O
going O
to O
be O
nuclear O
propulsion O
at O
this O
point O
again O
something O
we O
haven't O
really O
developed O
yet O
, O
because O
we O
could O
n't O
carry O
that O
much O
fuel O
, O
obviously O
. O

liquid O
oxygen O
would O
be O
way O
too O
heavy O
to O
carry O
all O
the O
way O
to O
mars B-LOC
. O

the O
bigger O
issue O
is O
once O
we O
get O
there O
, O
we O
ca O
n't O
carry O
oxygen O
or O
water O
or O
food O
to O
stay O
there O
three O
years O
, O
so O
we O
're O
going O
to O
have O
to O
do O
all O
of O
that O
on O
the O
surface O
of O
the O
planet O
. O

and O
think O
of O
it O
. O

mars B-LOC
is O
carbon O
dioxide O
. O

so O
we O
ca O
n't O
breathe O
there O
. O

so O
we O
're O
going O
to O
have O
to O
come O
up O
with O
some O
conversion O
technique O
to O
create O
water O
, O
to O
create O
oxygen O
and O
then O
some O
way O
of O
growing O
food O
on O
the O
planet O
itself O
. O

all O
of O
this O
is O
in O
the O
works O
now O
, O
but O
i O
think O
it O
's O
going O
to O
take O
quite O
a O
few O
years O
to O
develop O
it O
. O

you O
talk O
about O
the O
cosmic O
radiation O
. O

then O
of O
course O
there O
is O
the O
zero O
g O
bone O
loss O
, O
almost O
like O
the O
eroding O
of O
bone O
to O
humans O
that O
would O
be O
at O
risk O
as O
well O
. O

absolutely O
. O

there O
could O
be O
as O
much O
as O
50 O
% O
bone O
loss O
in O
astronauts O
in O
mars B-LOC
. O

why O
? O

during O
the O
time O
in O
mars B-LOC
. O

because O
when O
the O
body O
has O
-- O
when O
there O
is O
no O
dpravity O
as O
there O
is O
on O
mars B-LOC
, O
the O
body O
doesn't O
pick O
up O
the O
calcium O
in O
the O
bones O
, O
so O
it O
does O
n't O
keep O
getting O
the O
bones O
stronger O
and O
stronger O
. O

so O
they O
will O
just O
lose O
it O
. O

they O
will O
be O
almost O
like O
old O
people O
even O
at O
the O
age O
of O
40. O

Governor O

one O
in O
the O
Daily O

: O
Warner O

plan O

raise O

diversity O

short O

The O
article O
is O
full O
of O
innuendo O
that O
procurement O
officals O
are O
ignoring O
the O
Governor O
's O
wishes O
and O
just O
waiting O
for O
him O
to O
leave O
office O
, O
that O
`` O
special O

'' O
are O
cut O

and O
that O
somehow O
the O
electronic O

`` O
stacked O
'' O
against O
SWAM B-ORG
firms O

If O
true O
, O
these O
are O
serious O
charges O
, O
worthy O
of O
high-level O
investigation O

What O
's O
missing O
from O
the O
article O
, O
though O
, O
is O
any O
attempt O
at O
investigative O
journalism O
to O
give O
even O
one O

What O
's O
also O
missing O
is O
a O
fair-minded O
review O
of O
whether O
the O
sagging O
numbers O
reported O
for O
SWAM O
procurement O
are O
valid O
. O

Someday O
a O

time O
to O
watch O
a O
sample O

then O
use O

to O
determine O
if O
any O
SWAM B-ORG

were O
unfairly O
denied O

they O
deserved O
. O

Until O
then O
, O
this O
carping O

Governor O

done O
plenty O

Unless O
there O
's O
something O
in O
particular O
you O
want O
to O
see O
in O
Toronto B-LOC
, O
I O
do O
n't O
see O
any O
reason O
to O
make O
this O
long O
side O
trip O
. O

I O
would O
suggest O
heading O
back O
to O
Red B-LOC
Bank I-LOC
or O
wherever O
and O
trying O
to O
carve O
out O
an O
extra O
day O
in O
New B-LOC
York O
City B-LOC
. O

You O
can O
find O
hotels O
in O
your O
price O
range O
, O
especially O
with O
three O
sharing O
a O
room O
. O

You O
might O
want O
to O
drop O
off O
the O
car O
somewhere O
near O
Red B-LOC
Bank I-LOC
, O
or O
as O
soon O
as O
you O
arrive O
in O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
, O
if O
the O
drop O
off O
charges O
are O
n't O
too O
much O
. O

Then O
you O
could O
spend O
part O
of O
one O
day O
in O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
( O
and O
a O
good O
part O
of O
the O
next O
day O
, O
assuming O
you O
dropped O
Toronto B-LOC
) O
. O

Then O
you O
could O
take O
the O
train O
or O
bus O
back O
to O
Boston B-LOC
. O

It O
might O
work O
out O
cheaper O
in O
the O
long O
run O
, O
especially O
when O
you O
consider O
the O
cost O
of O
parking O
in O
New B-LOC

Hi O
Everyone O
, O
Thanks O
for O
all O
the O
great O
replies O
! O
! O

This O
is O
exactly O
what O
I O
'm O
looking O
for O
: O
) O
The O
main O
reason O
I O
'd O
like O
to O
goto O
Toronto B-LOC
and O
Niagara B-LOC
Falls I-LOC
is O
mainly O
because O
it O
's O
so O
close.. O
but O
I O
agree O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
would O
be O
nice O
to O
spend O
a O
few O
days O
in O
. O

I O
know O
the O
bulk O
of O
our O
trip O
is O
in O
Boston B-LOC
, O
but O
we O
have O
friends O
living O
up O
there O
we O
hope O
to O
spend O
a O
few O
days O
with O
visiting O
. O

The O
trip O
is O
both O
to O
visit O
with O
them O
and O
to O
spend O
time O
around O
New B-LOC
England I-LOC
. O

As O
for O
gas O
, O
what O
is O
the O
going O
rate O
for O
gas O
right O
now O
in O
New B-LOC
England I-LOC
? O

Here O
in O
Texas B-LOC
it O
's O
around O
$ O
1.60- O
$ O
1.75 O
for O
Reg O
Unleadded O
, O
but O
i'm O
figuring O
$ O
1.90 O
a O
gallon O
. O

Is O
this O
not O
accurate O
? O

Here O
's O
how O
I O
figured O
the O
price O
I O
'm O
factoring O
in O
-- O
Boston B-LOC
to O
Niagara B-LOC
Falls I-LOC
- O
467 O
Miles O
Niagara B-LOC
Falls I-LOC
to O
Toronto B-LOC
- O
85 O
Miles O
and O
85 O
Miles O
back O
Niagara B-LOC
Falls I-LOC
to O
Red B-LOC
Bank I-LOC
, O
NJ B-LOC
- O
435 O
Miles O
Red B-LOC
Bank I-LOC
, O
NJ B-LOC
to O
Boston B-LOC
( O
plus O
spending O
some O
time O
in O
NYC B-LOC
) O
- O
262 O
Total O
is O
1334 O
, O
but O
I O
'm O
figuring O
1500 O
with O
some O
extra O
for O
around O
NYC B-LOC
and O
various O
towns O
we O
visit O
. O

We O
're O
getting O
a O
mid-sized O
vehicle O
, O
so O
if O
the O
car O
gets O
20 O
mpg O
that O
's O
75 O
gallons O
used O
. O

This O
times O
$ O
1.90 O
is O
$ O
145.50 O
or O
around O
that O
. O

Even O
if O
gas O
is O
$ O
2.00 O
a O
gallon O
that O
's O
still O
only O
around O
$ O
150 O
, O
so O
I O
think O
$ O
200+ O
for O
gas O
is O
a O
rather O
high O
estimate O
. O

Also O
is O
it O
possible O
to O
take O
a O
train O
from O
Boston B-LOC
to O
NYC B-LOC
? O

If O
so O
how O
does O
that O
work O
or O
what O
's O
the O
cost O
? O

I O
am O
from O
Texas B-LOC
where O
we O
drive O
everywhere O
, O
and O
I O
've O
never O
even O
set O
foot O
on O
a O
train O
-- O
so O
forgive O
me O
if O
this O
is O
a O
weird O
question O
: O
) O
Thanks O
again O
for O
all O
the O
insight O
and O
help O
. O

Though O
I O
've O
never O
been O
up O
there O
I O
've O
always O
wanted O
to O
see O
both O
Niagara B-LOC
Falls I-LOC

Toronto B-LOC

so O
being O
so O

I O
almost O

Well O
, O
we O

we O
've O
something O
very O

it O
: O
A O

that O
would O
have O

even O

plenty O

I O

it O

they O

do O

aggregators O

The O
charismatic O
leader O
of O
Turkey B-LOC

party O
was O
named O

Tuesday O

step O
that O

just O
be O

there O
will O
be O

Also O
in O
Washington B-LOC

Turkish B-LOC

told O
The O

and O
Turkish B-LOC

were O
holding O
informal O
discussions O
on O
the O
use O
of O
Turkish B-LOC
airspace O
. O

The O
troop-basing O
resolution O
would O
allow O
the O
United B-LOC

to O
use O
Turkish B-LOC
airspace O

If O
the O
resolution O

The O
US B-LOC

use O
Hmong O
American O
sentiments O
against O
LPDR B-ORG
as O
the O
starting O
point O
for O
a O

in O
Laos B-LOC

However O
, O
Laos B-LOC

not O

goal O
; O
checkmate O
is O
the O
fall O
of O
China B-LOC
, O
and O
economic O
control O
of O

The O

to O
speak O
out O
against O
LPDR B-ORG
human O

With O
a O
precedant O

Laos B-LOC

be O
taken O

a O
source O
of O
invaluable O

for O
U.S B-LOC

military O
attacks O
on O
China B-LOC
. O

2 O
. O

The O
US B-LOC
's O
policy O
of O
handing O
out O
NTR O
will O
have O
the O
desired O
effect O
of O
reeling O
in O
alliances O
from O
the O
surrounding O
countries O
of O
China B-LOC
. O

Laos B-LOC
already O
has O
NTR O
. O

We O
shall O
wait O
and O
see O
if O
Chinese B-LOC
fat O
or O
American B-LOC
fat O
taste O
better O
to O
LPDR B-ORG
. O

If O
LPDR B-ORG
plays O
ball O
with O
Uncle B-LOC
Sam I-LOC
, O
then O
there O
will O
be O
no O
bloodshed O
in O
Laos B-LOC
. O

When O
the O
Americans O
get O
into O
Laos B-LOC
, O
the O
artificial O
cooperation O
will O
be O
sufficient O
for O
some O
strategic O
political O

Some O
Hmong O

may O
be O

Some O

be O
a O
good O
source O
of O

Chao O
Fa O

chance O
to O
replace O
their O
diet O

Again O
, O
America B-LOC
has O
LPDR B-ORG

and O
America B-LOC
can O
launch O
airstrikes O

Regardless O
of O
what O
happens O
, O
the O
U.S B-LOC
. O

has O
a O
direct O
ethnic O
connection O
to O
China B-LOC
by O
way O
of O
Hmong O
, O
which O
will O
secure O
CIA-insurgency B-ORG
operations O
. O

Unlike O
the O
current O
situation O
in O
the O
Middle-East B-LOC
, O
where O
the O
number O
of O
Arabic-speaking O
CIA B-ORG

are O
few O
, O
there O
will O
be O
plenty O
of O
Hmong/Chinese-speaking B-LOC
CIA B-ORG
agents O
for O
disposal O
and O
use O
in O
the O
looming O
Sino-US B-LOC
war O
. O

Perhaps O
by O
route O
of O
Thailand B-LOC
, O
if O
LPDR B-ORG
does O
not O
cooperate O
, O
the O
US B-LOC
will O
incite O
insurrection O
in O
the O
southern O
provinces O
of O
China B-LOC
. O

These O
provinces O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
Hmong O
people O
, O
and O
have O
been O
known O
to O
be O
the O
fiercest O
opposition O
to O
Chinese B-LOC
rule O
( O
aka O
Remember O
the O
Miao O

. O

This O
will O
be O
the O
Hmong O

God-given O
chance O
to O
fight O

Let O

all O

Everyone O
has O

the O
story O
: O
Beatriz O
Marinello O
was O
elected O
USCF B-ORG
President O
on O
August O
11 O
, O
2003 O
in O
Los B-LOC
Angeles I-LOC
. O

Immediately O
after O
she O
took O
office O
, O
she O
found O
out O
that O
the O
USCF B-ORG
had O
no O
money O
in O
the O
bank O
, O
zero O
. O

The O
USCF B-ORG
did O
not O
even O
have O
the O
money O
to O
pay O
the O
guaranteed O
prizes O
at O
the O
just O
concluded O
US B-LOC
Open O
in O
Los B-LOC
Angeles I-LOC
. O

Therefore O
, O
on O
August O
20 O
, O
2003 O
, O
bravely O
Beatriz O
walked O
into O
the O
USCF B-ORG
Offices O
in O
New B-LOC
Windsor I-LOC
and O
immediately O
fired O
17 O
staff O
members O
. O

John O
McCrary O
resigned O
from O
the O
board O
as O
a O
result O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
it O
was O
just O
a O
pure O
coincidence O
that O
the O
17 O
people O
Beatriz O
fired O
were O
the O
people O
she O
had O
grown O
to O
dislike O
during O
the O
year O
that O
she O
worked O
for O
the O
USCF B-ORG
in O
1999-2000 O
. O

It O
took O
six O
weeks O
before O
the O
USCF B-ORG
paid O
the O
guaranteed O
prizes O
the O
prize O
winners O
had O
won O
at O
the O
US B-LOC
Open O
. O

I O
have O
just O
found O
out O
something O
that O
insiders O
had O
known O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

The O
USCF B-ORG
did O
not O
have O
zero O
money O
in O
the O
bank O
. O

It O
had O
$ O
85,000 O
in O
another O
bank O
account O
that O
nobody O
knew O
about O
. O

This O
was O
not O
due O
to O
any O
malfeasance O
. O

The O
office O
accountant O
for O
the O
USCF B-ORG
had O
set O
up O
a O
separate O
bank O
account O
and O
had O
put O
the O
entry O
fees O
from O
the O
US B-LOC
Open O
into O
that O
account O
. O

Nobody O
knew O
about O
that O
separate O
bank O
account O
, O
except O
for O
the O
accountant O
herself O
. O

When O
this O
was O
discovered O
, O
the O
accountant O
explained O
that O
she O
was O
planning O
to O
keep O
the O
money O
in O
that O
account O
until O
the O
tournament O
was O
closed O
out O
. O

Perhaps O
the O
accountant O
was O
following O
a O
procedure O
followed O
by O
the O
USCF B-ORG
for O
scholastic O
tournaments O
. O

At O
scholastic O
tournaments O
, O
no O
cash O
prizes O
are O
paid O
. O

However O
, O
in O
adult O
tournaments O
, O
the O
players O
expect O
to O
receive O
their O
prizes O
, O
and O
to O
receive O
them O
immediately O
. O

For O
this O
act O
of O
stupidity O
which O
had O
caused O
a O
grave O
crisis O
in O
the O
USCF B-ORG
, O
the O
accountant O
was O
immediately O
fired O
. O

Had O
the O
existence O
of O
this O
$ O
85,000 O
in O
a O
secret O
bank O
account O
been O
known O
, O
it O
would O
not O
have O
been O
necessary O
to O
fire O
those O
17 O
people O
right O
away O
. O

Perhaps O
in O
the O
long O
run O
it O
was O
a O
good O
thing O
to O
fire O
them O
, O
but O
it O
might O
not O
have O
been O
a O

I O
knew O
that O
they O

a O
matter O
of O

during O
fiscal O
2004 O
resulting O
in O

overstatement O
of O

. O

And O
, O
of O
course O
, O
that O
is O
what O
happened O
. O

I O
just O
had O
no O
idea O
that O
the O
new O
Board O
would O
see O
it O
as O
leverage O
to O
seize O
power O
and O
pummel O
the O
office O
staff O
. O

Not O
only O
was O
there O
adequate O
cash O
put O
aside O
, O
we O
had O
approval O
for O
an O
equity O
loan O
on O
the O
building O
to O
bridge O
the O
move O
. O

But O
I O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
pay O
the O
$ O
10,000 O
points O
and O
interest O
unless O
and O
until O
it O
was O
absolutely O
necessary O
. O

We O
also O
had O
a O
buyer O
for O
the O
building O
at O
a O
prize O
much O
higher O
than O
it O
was O
eventually O
sold O
for O
and O
a O
commitment O
for O
4 O
% O

Staff O

were O
clearly O

by O
any O

Miami B-LOC

To O

was O
absurd O

the O
reason O
for O

ADVOCATE O
Another O

This O
is O
a O
medical O
malpractice O
crisis O
. O

Over O
80,000 O
Americans O
, O
220 O
every O
day O
die O
from O
medical O
negligence O
, O
hundred O
of O
thousands O
are O
injured O
. O

And O
the O
insurance O
companies O
which O
had O
relatively O
steady O
rates O
on O
doctors O
for O
about O
10 O
years O
have O
found O
its O
investment O
income O
, O
its O
interest O
income O
, O
the O
stock O
market O
collapse O
down O
. O

And O
so O
they O
're O
jacking O
up O
the O
rates O
on O
a O
few O
key O
specialties O
like O
obstetricians O
and O
neurosurgeons O

But O
if O
you O
take O
the O
entire O
amount O
of O
premiums O

Bob O

that O
's O
paid O
by O
doctors O
in O
this O
country O
to O
malpractice O
insurers O
and O
divide O
it O
evenly O
, O
they O
'd O
be O
paying O
less O
than O
$ O
9,000 O
each O
. O

That O
's O
one-third O
of O
what O
they O
pay O
a O

NOVAK O

runs O
against O

PALMISANO O
Well O
, O
the O
current O
medical O
liability O
system O
is O
affecting O
patients O
in O
that O
they O
ca O
n't O
get O

The O
American B-ORG
Medical O
Association B-ORG
works O
very O
hard O
to O
make O
safety O
a O
priority O
in O
the O
medical O
care O
system O
. O

That's O
why O
we O
founded O
the O
National B-ORG
Patient O
Safety O
Foundation B-ORG
. O

The O
current O
system O
does O
n't O
measure O

. O

It O
measures O
disability O

And O
what O
we're O
finding O
now O
is O
that O
the O
emergency O

are O
closing O

trauma O

are O

pregnant O
women O
ca O

were O
no O

The O

Who O
are O
you O

who O

our O

tell O
him O

his O

only O
worth O
$ O
250,000 O
for O
the O
loss O
of O
a O
child O
? O

PALMISANO O
Well O
, O
what O
has O
to O
be O
done O
here O
is O
balance O
. O

What O
we O
need O
is O
a O
system O
that O
's O
fair O
to O
everyone O
, O
a O
system O
that O
keeps O
the O
physicians O
in O
practice O
and O
allows O
patients O
to O
have O
access O
to O
physicians O
in O
their O
hour O
of O
need O

And O
the O
system O
in O
California B-LOC
that O
's O
in O
the O
bill O
, O
in O
Congress B-ORG
now O
, O
HR-5 O
, O
that O

a O

Controversial O
PLO B-ORG
leader O
Yasser O
Arafat O
died O
in O
a O
Paris B-LOC

Do O

help O
or O
hurt O
the O
Israeli-Palestinian B-LOC
peace O
process O
? O

Was O
Arafat O
a O

toward O
Palestine B-LOC
now O
that O
Arafat O
has O

Ali O
Uh O

so O
let O
me O
ask O
you O
, O
do O
you O
think O
Arafat O
was O
, O
uh O
, O
a O
good O
leader O
or O
not O
? O

Mark O
Um O
, O
to O
hi- O
-- O
yeah O
, O
I- O
-- O
I O
think O
he O
did O
what O
he O
thought O
-- O
was O
right O
for O
his O
people O
. O

I- O
I- O
-- O
I O
would O
say O
he O
was O
a O
good O
leader O
-- O
for- O
-- O
for O
, O
uh O
, O
his O
people O
. O

And O
as O
far O
as O
our O
involvement O
there O
, O
should O
be O
as O
little O
as O
possible O
. O

Just O
let O
them O
do O
-- O
what O
they O
, O
you O
know O
, O
what O
they're O
going O
to O
do O
-- O
and O
we O
should O
stay O
out O
of O
it O
( O
( O
just O
) O
) O
as O
-- O
much O
as O
we O
can O
. O

Uh O
, O
this O
country O
seems O
to O
get O
involved O
too O
much O
in O
other O
people's O
politics O
. O

Should O
just O
let O
them O
do O
whatever O
they O
're O
going O
to O
do O
, O
Ali O
Uh O
, O
Mark O
you O
know O
. O

Ali O
mm O
, O
by O
the O
way O
I O
am O
from O
Arab O
origin O
, O
so O
I O
also O
have O
, O
uh O
, O
uh O
, O
the O
same O
opinion O
-- O
like O
you O
. O

I O
believe O
he O
-- O
-- O
in O
my O
opinion O
he- O
he O
was O
a O
good O
leader O
-- O
and O
, O
um O
, O
I O
believe O
what O
, O
eh O
, O
has O
to O
be O
done O
-- O
right O
now O
is O
to O
( O
( O
apply O
) O
) O
-- O
the O
United B-ORG
Nations I-ORG
' O
, O
uh O
, O
decisions O
about O
the O
conflict O
between O
Arab O
and O
Israel B-LOC
because O
there O
is O
-- O
-- O
there O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
, O
uh O
, O
decisions O
have O
been O
made O
-- O
have O
been O
made O
-- O
and O
this O
, O
uh- O
For O
example O
, O
one O
of O
them O
was O
, O
uh O
, O
decision O
number O
two O
forty-two O
-- O
and O
this O
was O
about O
-- O
the O
ha- O
establishing O
two- O
two O
countries O
, O
one O
for O
Israel B-LOC
and O
another O
one O
for O
Palestine B-LOC
. O

Mark O
Right O
. O

Ali O
So O
, O
if O
we O
-- O
-- O
eh O
, O
if O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
, O
Bush O
, O
Israel B-LOC
( O
( O
told O
) O
) O
th- O
the O
solution O
or O
to O
, O
uh O
, O
to O
make O
the O
decision O
, O
eh O
, O
I O
think O
this O
will O
solve O
-- O
the O
problem O
. O

The O
-- O
unfortunately O
what O
happens O
right O
now- O
-- O
The O
-- O
for O
example O
, O
which O
is O
-- O
little O
bit O
toward O
it's- O
it O
's O
interest O
. O

For O
example O
, O
when O
there O
was O
, O
uh O
, O
like O
, O
a O
-- O
decision O
against O
Iraq B-LOC
, O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
-- O
went O
directly O
-- O
to O
Iraq B-LOC
to O
-- O
-- O
for O
, O
eh O
, O
uh O
, O
an O
invasion O
-- O
and O
-- O
for O
-- O
whatever O
reasons- O
-- O
she O
even O
was O
out O
, O
uh O
, O
putting O
any O
attention O
to O
the O
United B-ORG
Nations I-ORG
, O
uh O
, O
like O
, O
uh O
, O
approval O
. O

She O
did O
wha- O
what O
she O
want O
. O

But O
, O
eh O
, O
eh O
, O
for O
Israeli B-LOC
, O
Palestinian B-LOC
conflict O
there O
's O
a O
lot O
of O
decisions O
that O
has O
to O
be O
-- O
applied O
but O
until O
now O
-- O
she O
did O
n't O
put O
any O
pressure O
, O
eh O
, O
toward O
( O
( O
this O
and O
) O
) O
and O
I O
believe O
this O
policy O
has O
been O
, O
uh O
, O
this O
kind O
of O
policy O
, O
eh O
, O
um O
, O
eh O
, O
became O
more O
and O
more O
during O
-- O
eh O
, O
during O
, O
uh O
, O
eh O
, O
Bush O
-- O
-- O
President O
Bush O
time O
. O

For O
example O
, O
before O
, O
eh O
, O
during O
Clinton O
, O
I O
believe O
at O
that O
time O
-- O
Clinton O
was O
trying O
hard O
-- O
to O
solve O
this O
problem O
and O
I O
believe O
at O
that O
time O
, O
if O
you O
remember O
, O
um O
, O
Yasser O
Arafat O
-- O
and O
, O
uh O
, O
the O
prime O
minister O
of O
Israel B-LOC
, O
his O
name O
was O
Barak O
, O
they O
met O
together O
in O
the O
White O
House O
-- O
and O
-- O
they O
almost O
came O
to O
an O
agreement O
-- O
to O
solve O
this O
problem O
-- O
and O
during O
Clinton O
, O
eh O
, O
period O
-- O
they O
had O
, O
uh O
, O
this O
( O
( O
Oslo B-LOC
) O
) O
a- O
eh O
, O
agreement O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
big O
problems O
between O
the O
two O
parties O
, O
they O
negotiated O
everything O
almost O
and O
there O
is O
-- O
there O
were O
, O
like O
, O
final O
steps O
that O
have O
to O
be O
solved O
. O

But O
, O
uh O
, O
I O
think O
if O
there O
was O
, O
like O
, O
the O
, O
um O
, O
the O
same O
policy O
has O
to O
be O
followed O
after O
Clinton O
. O

I O
think O
-- O
everything O
would- O
-- O
-finished O
then- O
-- O
the O
-- O
I O
think O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
-- O
went O
to O
another O
direction O
and O
, O
eh O
, O
they O
forgot O
about O
this O
problem O
right O
now O
. O

Mark O
Yeah O
, O
I O
g- O
eh O
, O
see O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
, O
Ali O
Mark O
um O
, O
when- O
when O
policy O
is O
set O
by O
one O
-- O
-- O
by O
one O
president O
-- O
towards- O
towards O
one O
thing O
, O
it O
's O
usually O
-- O
followed O
through O
, O
if O
there O
is O
something O
to O
follow O
through O
, O
by O
the O
-- O
next O
president O
in O
turn O
. O

He O
is O
more O
or O
less O
obligated O
-- O
to O
continue O
, O
uh O
, O
the O
process O
that O
was O
already O
started O
-- O
but O
-- O
I O
think O
-- O
Bush O
's O
-- O
agenda O
-- O
is O
not O
-- O
towards O
that O
right O
now O
. O

That O
is O
not O
his O
priority O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
. O

Ali O
Yeah O
, O
I O
think O
so O
, O
yes O
. O

Mark O
And O
, O
eh O
, O
uh O
, O
although O
, O

the O

is O

a O

taking O

as O
to O
why O
she O
stepped O
down O

the O

she O

it O

The O
problem O

that O
hardly O
anyone O

Now O
precisely O
what O

, O
nice O

you O
. O

Paul O
Uh O
, O
well O
, O
pretty O
complicated O
-- O
topic O
. O

Mike O
Yeah O
, O
interesting O
issue O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O

What O
do O
you O
think O
? O

You O
think O
it O
was O
poison O
? O

Paul O
Well O
-- O
( O
( O
smoosh O
) O
) O
no O
, O
I O
I O
heard O
that O
just O
a O
couple O
of O
days O
ago O
and O
-- O
I O
I O
kind O
of O
doubt O
it O
or O
at O
least O
I O
hope O
not O
. O

I O
guess O
that O
's O
what O
it O
is O
. O

Mike O
Yeah O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
he O
was O
poisoned O
. O

I O
think O
he O
was O
just O
fr- O
frail O
and O
I O
think O
he O
'd O
been O
uh O
, O
he O
'd O
been O
looking O
frail O
and O
he O
was O
shaky O
. O

Paul O
Yeah O
. O

Mike O
You O
know O
, O
he O
'd O
been O
looking O
h- O
like O
he O
was O
shaking O
and O
, O
uh O
, O
seeming O
frail O
. O

For O
some O
time O
when O
I O
'd O
see O
him O
in O
public O
, O
uh O
, O
Paul O
Yeah O
, O
that O
's O
true O
. O

Mike O
presentation O
-- O
so O
forth O
. O

Paul O
Right O
. O

Mike O
And O
I O
think O
it O
whatever O
it O
was O
, O
it O
got O
him O
, O
just O
caught O
up O
with O
him O
and O
and O
he O
reached O
the O
you O
know O
, O
the O
end O
of O
his O
time O
. O

Paul O
Yeah O
. O

Mike O
So O
, O
that O
's O
about O
it O
on O
that O
, O
I O
guess O
. O

Paul O
Yeah O
. O

Well O
, O
I O
I O
guess O
now O
that O
that O
he O
's O
he O
's O
died O
-- O
it O
'll O
be O
, O
uh O
, O
or O
it O
it O
should O
be O
a O
change O
for O
the O
~PLO B-ORG
Mike O
Well O
, O
yeah O
, O
it O
'll O
be O
change O
. O

I O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
it O
'll O
move O
forward O
any O
better O
-- O
but O
, O
uh O
, O
this O
, O
uh O
, O
I O
've O
heard O
our O
administration O
thinks O
it O
will O
. O

I O
think O
he O
was O
a O
block O
to O
the O
peace O
-- O
but O
I O
think O
it O
's O
not O
only O
his O
doing O
, O
it O
's O
also O
the O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
the O
, O
uh O
, O
more O
, O
uh O
, O
drastic O
elements O
of O
the O
~PLO B-ORG
that O
, O
uh O
, O
that O
, O
uh O
, O
would O
n't O
allow O
him O
to O
pursue O
peace O
Paul O
Right O
. O

Mike O
at O
any O
cost O
. O

Paul O
Well O
, O
I O
'm O
-- O
I O
'm O
-- O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
uh O
. O

He O
he O
seems O
like O
a O
guy O
who O
is O
much O
more O
comfortable O
-- O
being O
under O
siege O
than O
in O
negotiating O
peace O
settlements O
. O

Mike O
Uh-huh O
. O

Paul O
Um O
, O
I O
Mike O
Yeah O
. O

Paul O
maybe O
that O
Mike O
Well O
, O
you O
know O
, O
he O
was O
kind O
of O
damned O
if O
he O
did O
and O
damned O
if O
he O
did O
n't O
. O

Paul O
Yeah O
. O

Well O
Mike O
You O
know O
, O
if O
he O
if O
he O
made O
peace O
he O
had O
factions O
of O
his O
own O
people O
that O
would O
've O
killed O
him O
-- O
and O
if O
he O
did O
n't O
make O
peace O
, O
eh O
, O
then O
he's O
considered O
, O
you O
know O
, O
the O
the O
warmongering O
, O
uh O
, O
man O
who O
wo O
n't O
make O
peace O
, O
you O
know O
. O

So O
, O
he O
, O
uh O
, O
he O
could O
n't O
really O
win O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
he O
could O
make O
peace O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
anyone O
else O
can O
, O
either O
. O

Paul O
Yeah O
, O
I O
guess O
that O
's O
the O
big O
question O
, O
if O
someone O
moderate O
takes O
over O
and O
they O
reach O
a O
settlement O
, O
does O
that O
mean O
the O
~PLO B-ORG
will O
split O
? O

I O
mean O
that O
-- O
that O
could O
be O
just O
-- O
dangerous O
. O

Mike O
Yeah O
. O

Paul O
I O
guess O
, O
uh O
, O
making O
peace O
with O
half O
of O
the O
Palestinians O
is O
better O
than O
nothing O
. O

Mike O
One O
of O
the O
other O
questions O
it O
asked O
us O
was O
, O
did O
we O
think O
our O
president O
and O
our O
, O
uh O
, O
you O
know O
, O
officials O
should O
've O
attended O
his O
funeral O
. O

Paul O
( O
( O
Oh O
, O
I O
b- O
) O
) O
Mike O
What O
do O
you O
think O
about O
that O
? O

Paul O
Yeah O
. O

Well O
, O
I O
I O
do O
n't O
remember O
who O
they O
sent O
, O
but O
they O
did O
send O
over O
some O
very O
-- O
low O
level O
state B-ORG
department I-ORG
person O
Mike O
Oh O
, O
I O
see O
. O

Paul O
and O
, O
uh O
, O
Mike O
I O
did O
n't O
know O
that O
. O

Paul O
I O
I O
-- O
I O
was O
kind O
of O
embarrassed O
about O
that O
. O

Mike O
That O
we O
did O
or O
d- O
that O
we O
did O
not O
send O
our O
officials O
. O

Paul O
I O
mean O
-- O
We O
-- O
we O
did O
, O
but O
i- O
it O
was O
some O
-- O
it O
was O
a O
nobody O
, O
basically O
. O

Mike O
So O
you O
were O
embarrassed O
because O
you O
thought O
they O
should O
've O
sent O
someone O
higher O
up O
? O

Paul O
Yeah O
. O

Mike O
Oh O
, O
I O
see O
. O

Paul O
I O
I O
-- O
I O
mean O
, O
for O
for O
the O
funeral O
ceremony O
in O
, O
uh O
, O
Egypt B-LOC
. O

( O
( O
I O
mean O
) O
) O
Mike O
Yeah O
, O
I O
think O
so O
, O
too O
. O

I O
think O
they O
should O
've O
sent O
someone O
higher O
up O
. O

Paul O
And O
, O
uh O
, O
I O
I O
can O
understand O
that O
they O
would O
n't O
want O
to O
send O
anybody O
Mike O
( O
( O
that O
he O
) O
) O
-- O
Do O
n't O
forget O
this O
was O
the O
this O
was O
the O
representative O
of O
a O
whole O
people O
, O
you O
know O
what O
I O
mean O
? O

Paul O
Yeah O
. O

Mike O
The O
past O
he O
was O
their O
main O
representative O
and O
, O
uh O
, O
just O
out O
of O
respect O
for O
the O
people O
we O
should O
've O
sent O
someone O
I O
think O
. O

Paul O
Hm O
. O

Bad O
bad O
or O
good O
. O

Yeah O
, O
I O
think O
it O
would O
've O
been O
a O
much O
more O
positive O
message O
. O

Mike O
Yeah O
. O

Paul O
( O
( O
We O
realized O
that O
) O
) O
Mike O
I O
think O
it O
would O
've O
, O
uh O
, O
you O
know O
, O
been O
a O

a O
step O

, O
um O

you O

I O
do O

, O
the O
respect O
and O
and O
the O
, O
um O
, O
Paul O
Right O
. O

Yeah O
, O
I O
think O
that O
Mike O
uh O
, O
th- O
of O
the O
people O
that O
we O
're O
going O
to O
have O
to O
be O
working O
with O
to O
try O
to O
bring O
about O
a O
peace O
, O
you O
know O
. O

Paul O
that O
( O
( O
yeah O
, O
) O
) O
it O
-- O
Yeah O
. O

Mike O
And O
, O
uh O
, O
it O
would O
've O
-- O
gone O
an- O
a O
little O
farther O
to O

to O
, O
you O
know O
, O
be O
willing O
to O
sit O
down O
at O
the O
table O
with O
us O
, O
at O
least O
, O
you O
know O
. O

Paul O
That O
's O
true O
. O

Mike O
And O
, O
I O
mean O
not O
that O
it O
would O
've O
even O
been O
noticed O
-- O
in O
that O
regard O
had O
he O
-- O
had O
had O
our O
president O
or O
someone O
higher O
gone O
, O
but O
the O
fact O
that O
they O
did O
n't O
, O
that O
's O
what O
's O
really O
going O
to O
be O
noticed O
, O
you O
know O
what O
I O
mean O
? O

Paul O
Yeah O
. O

Well O
, O
uh O
, O
you O
know O
, O
Colin O
Powell O
is O
a O
-- O
pretty O
moderate O

and O
would O

, O
uh O
, O
at O

title O
game O
against O
a O
four-loss O
Colorado B-ORG
team O

ca O
n't O

The O
result O
was O
a O
40 O
plus O
point O
beatdown O
, O
but O
what O
did O
anyone O
expect O
? O

Auburn B-ORG
played O
15th O
ranked O
Tennessee B-ORG
and O
was O
attempting O
to O
do O
one O
of O
the O
toughest O
things O
to O
do O
in O
college O
football O
: O
beating O
a O
team O
twice O
in O
the O
same O
year O
. O

With O
the O
exception O
of O
a O
15 O
yard O
shanked O
punt O
and O
a O
punt O
snap O
that O
Kody O
Bliss O
missed O
while O
having O
an O
apparent O
thrombosis O
, O
Auburn B-ORG
led O
21-7 O
at O
the O
half O
and O
had O
held O
UT B-ORG
to O
46 O
yards O
of O
offense O
. O

While O
the O
Auburn B-ORG
running O
game O
was O
held O
up O
, O
Jason O
Campbell O
threw O
it O
all O
over O
the O
ball O
field O
and O
, O
when O
his O
receivers O
were O
covered O
, O
he O
ran O
for O
yardage O
on O
his O
own O
. O

This O
despite O
several O

to O
the O

low O
hits O
at O
his O
knees O
and O
ankles O
, O
and O
various O
other O
assaults O
outside O
the O
realm O
of O
good O
sportsmanship O
. O

Tennessee B-ORG
scored O
on O
a O
pass O
play O
that O
was O
incorrectly O
ruled O
a O
touchdown O
, O
since O
the O
ball O
clearly O
touched O
the O
turf O
, O
and O
that O
's O
where O
the O
momentum O
of O
the O
game O
changed O
. O

I O
think O
it O
was O
also O
at O
that O
point O
that O
the O
scoreboard O
began O
to O
reflect O
Auburn B-ORG
's O
last O
title O
hopes O
dying O
as O
the O
Oklahoma-Colorado B-ORG
score O
would O
have O
begun O
showing O
the O
beat-down O
that O
was O
occuring O
. O

Auburn B-ORG
was O
tied O
21-21 O
and O
in O
jeapordy O
of O
losing O
it O
most O
important O
game O
ever O
, O
but O
senior O
QB O
Jason O
Campbell O
would O
have O
none O
of O
it O
. O

Auburn B-ORG
won O
going O
away O
38-28 O
, O
and O
the O
only O
place O
the O
game O
looked O
close O
was O
on O
the O
scoreboard O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
believe O
that O
an O
undefeated O
SEC B-ORG
team O
is O
not O
playing O
for O
a O
title O
, O
but O
I O
guess O
we O
can O
thank O
Jeff O
Sagarin O
and O
the O
other O
dicks O
that O
keep O
voting O
USC B-ORG
number O
one O
to O
make O
up O
for O
what O
happened O
to O
them O
last O
year O
. O

All O
I O
know O
is O
that O
they O
better O
think O
that O
way O
next O
year O
, O
because O
it O
's O
Auburn B-ORG
that O
got O
screwed O
this O
year O
. O

And O
what O
's O
better O
is O
that O
Auburn B-ORG
gets O
to O
play O
one O
of O
the O
three O
hottest O
teams O
in O
the O
country O
in O
my O
opinion O
. O

Virginia B-ORG
Tech I-ORG
is O
talented O
, O
very O
athletic O
and O
one O
of O
the O
most O
well O
coached O
teams O
in O
the O
country O
and O
they O
WILL O
come O
to O
play O
on O
January O
3rd O
. O

I O
hope O
our O
kids O
can O
shake O
off O
this O
travesty O
and O
focus O
on O
making O
the O
pollsters O
look O

Maybe O
an O

Bush O
Cabinet O
President O
Bush O
has O
just O
been O
elected O
to O
another O
term O
in O
office O
, O
and O
he O
has O
already O
started O
to O
appoint O
new O
people O
to O
his O
political O
cabinet O
as O
current O
members O
like O
Colin O
Powell O
and O
John O
Ashcroft O
resign O
. O

Who O
would O
you O
like O
to O
see O
appointed O
to O
his O
cabinet O
next O
term O
? O

Who O
are O
they O
, O
and O
why O
do O
you O
think O
they O
should O
be O
appointed O
? O

If O
you O
were O
president O
, O
which O
national O
figures O
would O
you O
appoint O
to O
your O
cabinet O
and O
why O
? O

What O
new O
cabinet O
positions O
would O
you O
create O
and O
who O
would O
fill O
them O
? O

A O
I O
I O
'm O
sorry O
to O
see O
Colin O
Powell O
leave O
, O
leaving O
. O

I O
think O
he O
's O
probably O
one O
of O
the O
most O
-- O
diplomatic O
-- O
um O
, O
men O
that O
I O
've O
seen O
in O
politics O
. O

B O
So O
do O
I O
. O

A O
He O
he O
's O
very O
honest O
, O
he O
's O
very O
strong O
in O
his O
beliefs O
, O
and O
I O
'm O
sorry O
to O
see O
him O
go O
. O

I O
'm O
also O
sorry O
to O
see O
Tom O
Ridge O
resigning O
. O

Um O
B O
I O
am O
too O
, O
and O
you O
know O
what O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
where O
, O
do O
you O
know O
anything O
about O
his O
background O
? O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
where O
he O
came O
from O
. O

A O
he O
's O
the O
Governor O
of O
, O
he O
was O
the O
Governor O
of O
Pennsylvania B-LOC
. O

B O
Oh O
, O
that O
's O
right O
. O

Okay O
. O

A O
And O
um O
after O
uh O
B O
Now O
I O
remember O
. O

A O
he O
before O
nine O
eleven O
, O
he O
was O
-- O
he O
was O
on O
an O
advisory O
committal O
-- O
committee O
-- O
to O
the O
Gover- O
to O
the O
President O
I O
guess O
, O
besides O
him O
running O
uh O
Pennsylvania B-LOC
, O
and O
then O
after O
nine O
eleven O
they O
appointed O
him O
you O
know O
, O
head O
of O
Homeland B-ORG
Security I-ORG
, O
and O
then O
created O
the O
B O
Uh-huh O
. O

A O
uh O
Secretary O
's O
position O
for O
him O
, O
or O
for O
someone O
, O
but O
him O
being O
the O
person O
at O
that O
time O
. O

I O
just O
think O
that O
B O
Yeah O
. O

Yeah O
. O

A O
it O
's O
so O
soon O
-- O
since O
nine O
eleven O
, O
and O
he O
has O
been O
creating O
his O
own O
job O
, O
i- O
in O
essence O
, O
because O
it O
's O
such O
a O
new O
position O
. O

But O
, O
I O
think O
it O
's O
-- O
it O
would O
've O
been O
-- O
better O
to O
have O
one O
person O
-- O
like O
continuing O
that O
. O

However O
, O
B O
I O
do O
too O
. O

I O
I O
do O
too O
. O

I O
hate O
to O
I O
hate O
to O
change O
-- O
change O
horses O
there O
so O
quickly O
. O

A O
yeah O
. O

B O
Uh O
I O
I O
I O
'd O
that O
-- O
that O
-- O
job O
uh O
uh O
needs O
continuity O
-- O
for O
a O
while O
. O

Anyhow O
. O

You O
know O
, O
I O
m- O
I O
mean O
, O
at O
least O
until O
they O
get O
A O
Yeah O
. O

B O
settled O
on O
what O
the O
job O
really O
is O
. O

A O
Yeah O
, O
well O
uh O
maybe O
maybe O
on O
one O
hand O
-- O
somebody O
new O
will O
bring O
a O
new O
perspective O
to O
it O
, O
which O
would O
-- O
be O
helpful O
, O
but O
I O
still O
think O
that O
B O
Uh O
yeah O
A O
the O
people O
that O
are O
up O
for O
it O
-- O
there O
's O
some O
p- O
B O
Yeah O
, O
but O
if O
it O
's O
if O
the O
perspective O
is O
too O
new O
, O
you O
know O
, O
that O
's O
not O
going O
to O
be O
a O
good O
thing O
, O
because O
uh O
wholesale O
changes O
is O
not O
what O
they O
need O
to O
do O
. O

A O
yeah O
. O

Yeah O
. O

B O
Uh O
uh O
no O
matter O
who O
takes O
it O
over O
. O

They O
need O
to O
they O
need O
to O
-- O
think O
long O
and O
hard O
before O
they O
start O
making O
changes O
. O

Because O
if O
they O
make O
one O
wrong O
one O
, O
you O
know O
, O
it O
A O
But O
there O
are O
there O
are O
a O
couple O
women O
up O
for O
-- O
the O
position O
as O
well O
as O
um O
you O
know O
, O
a O
few O
men O
that O
are O
up O
for O
the O
position O
. O

And O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
anything O
about O
the O
women O
that O
are O
up O
for O
the O
position O
. O

Um O
-- O
one O
-- O
two O
of O
the O
men O
are O
from O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
, O
one O
is O
a O
Head O
of O
-- O
the O
the O
-- O
who O
was O
there O
at O
nine O
eleven O
. O

He O
was O
the O
Chief O
of O
Police B-ORG
. O

Or O
the O
Commissioner O
-- O
of O
of O

I O
guess O
. O

Uh O
who O
was O
with O
Giuliani O
throughout O
the O
whole O
thing O
. O

B O
Uh-huh O
. O

A O
Um O
they O
're O
also O
thinking O
about O
Giuliani O
, O
so O
-- O
I O
mean O
, O
I O
think O
they O
have O
some O
qualified O
candidates O
. O

B O
Yeah O
. O

A O
However O
, O
I O
think O
-- O
with O
it O
's O
Homeland B-ORG
Security I-ORG
, O
which O
means O
it O
can't O
just O
be O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
, O
which O
is O
where O
of O
course O
, O
their O
focus O
is O
going O
to O
be O
. O

B O
Sure O
. O

A O
Having O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
been O
there O
, O
and O
through O
that O
. O

So O
, O
as O
long O
as O
they O
do O
n't O
have O
blinders O
on O
, O
you O
know O
, O
I O
would O
be O
okay O
with O
that O
, O
but O
they O
've O
got O
to O
look O
, O
obviously O
-- O
at O
ports O
-- O
nuclear O
power O
plants O
, O
you O
know O
, O
and O
oth- O
other O
areas O
where O
we O
are O
vulnerable O
. O

B O
Yeah O
. O

Yeah O
, O
and O
you O
know O
what O
's O
really O
scary O
to O
me O
? O

I O
I O
do O
n't O
I've O
never O
seen O
it O
mentioned O
, O
I O
've O
never O
-- O
but O
-- O
but O
if O
they O
really O
wanted O
to O
to O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
uh O
uh O
uh O
if O
they O
if O
they O
really O
wanted O
to O
put O
-- O
fear O
in O
the O
American B-LOC
people O
, O
uh O
-- O
I O
know O
it O
would O
work O
with O
me O
, O
is O
if O
they O
say O
just O
uh O
if O
if O
-- O
I O
say O
they O
, O
Bin O
Laden O
, O
or O
who O
whoever O
-- O
uh O
-- O
uh O
is O
running O
that O
team O
now O
, O
uh O
were O
to O
-- O
were O
to O
just O
pick O
a O
small O
-- O
Mid- B-LOC
American I-LOC
town O
, O
A O
Mhm O
. O

B O
uh O
and O
just O
wipe O
it O
out O
, O
A O
Yeah O
, O
no O
, O
and O
I O
I O
thi- O
I O
think O
that O
's O
a O
great O
fear O
. O

B O
you O
know O
, O
and O
there O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
ways O
-- O
there O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
ways O
to O
do O
that O
. O

I O
mean O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
it O
would O
n't O
take O
a O
nuclear O
weapon O
. O

A O
No O
, O
no O
. O

B O
uh O
uh O
and O
it O
it O
could O
be O
done O
so O
easily O
because O
i- O
i- O
most O
small O
towns O
are O
protected O
by O
a O
small O
town O
police O
force O
. O

A O
Mhm O
. O

B O
You O
know O
? O

And O
that O
's O
it O
. O

A O
Well O
, O
I O
think O
that O
-- O
there O
's O
-- O
really O
-- O
been O
a O
strengthening O
, O
and O
I O
hope O
they O
can O
-- O
get O
it O
together O
without O
this O
. O

Part O
of O
the O

with O
that O
is O
the O
~CIA B-ORG

the O
~FBI B-ORG
and O
who O
's O
going O
to O
be O
in O

because O
they O
want O
to O

this O

. O

B O
( O
( O
I O
) O
) O
No O
, O
they O
've O
always O
A O
And O
, O
so O
nobody O
wants O
to O

give O
up O

power O
B O
Yeah O
. O

A O
and O
, O
you O
know O
, O
you O
-- O
in O
this O
case O
, O
and O
and O
going O

we O

i O

i O
was O

that O
my O
dear O
friend O
was O
in O
when O
he O
was O
killed O
outside O

but O
i O
had O
long O
thought O
and O
i O
was O
in O
iraq B-LOC
in O
the O
previous O

that O
really O
all O
the O
talk O
that O
had O
been O
about O
the O
rush O
to O
war O
, O
the O
push O
for O
war O
, O
the O
drive O
for O
war O
, O
all O
that O
propaganda O
, O
was O
essentially O
nonsensical O
because O
in O
1990 O
, O
saddam O
hussein O
made O
the O
only O
self O
criticism O
. O

he O
said O
, O
i O
could O
either O
invade O
kuwait B-LOC
or O
finish O
developing O
the O
nuclear O
weapon O
. O

maybe O
before O
the O
weapon O
and O
then O
later O
he O
said O
, O
oh O
, O
i O
should O
have O
got O
the O
nuclear O
weapon O
before O
i O
invaded O
. O

he O
was O
right O
about O
that O
. O

but O
that O
means O
that O
he O
inaugurated O
at O
that O
point O
like O
a O
dozen-year O
's O
war O
where O
the O
united B-LOC
states I-LOC
could O
be O
criticized O
for O
doing O
too O
little O
and O
acting O
too O
slowly O
but O
all O
we O
're O
arguing O
about O
lately O
is O
to O
do O
with O
those O
that O
should O
have O
been O
finished O
in O
'91 O
when O
it O
could O
have O

should O
have O
taken O

taken O

helping O

done O

that O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
core O
of O
the O
argument O

as O
you O
point O
out O
, O
of O
course O
, O
for O
the O
fact O
of O
the O
matter O
is O
, O
the O
mistakes O
of O
saddam O

made O
possible O
his O
removal O
from O

the O
mistakes O

norman O

we O

keep O

and O
he O
says O

that O

all O
right O

they O
ask O
again O
, O
are O
you O
sure O
they O
mean O
that O
? O

they O
ca O
n't O
believe O
the O
luck O

they O
use O
the O

kill O
, O
we O
think O

not O
less O

50,000 O

The O

I O

I O
have O
a O

spot O
in O

As O
far O
as O
I O
could O

many O
people O

spend O

drinking O

their O

Really O
not O
a O

. O

Anyway O
, O
back O
on O
topic O
here O
. O

Market O
over O
reaction O
? O

Hard O
to O
say O
. O

Both O
companies O
have O
pricey O
stocks O
and O
those O
valuations O
are O
based O
on O
optimistic O
expectations O
of O
future O
growth O
. O

Yesterday O
's O
news O
led O
many O
to O
question O
their O
growth O
assumptions O
for O
these O
companies O
. O

Today O
I O
want O
to O
talk O
a O
bit O
about O
Starbucks B-ORG
. O

I O
think O
I O
have O
to O
start O
by O
acknowledging O
that O
the O
stock O
is O
still O
pricey O
even O
after O
its O
drop O
yesterday O
. O

However O
, O
my O
organizational O
indicators O
analysis O
reveals O
a O
very O
low O
level O
of O
business O
risk O
. O

This O
may O
partially O
justify O
a O
higher O
P/E O
ratio O
. O

A O
couple O
weeks O
ago O
, O
I O
observed O
that O
Wal-Mart B-ORG
had O
offsetting O
strong O
and O
weak O
organizational O
indicators O
. O

Starbucks B-ORG
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
has O
uniformly O
strong O
organizational O
indicators O
. O

Starbucks B-ORG
scores O
as O
best O
in O
its O
industry O
on O
six O
of O
seven O
organizational O
indicators O
. O

Not O
surprising O
are O
its O
strong O
scores O
in O
the O
employee O
relations O
and O
stakeholder O
actions O
indicators O
. O

Its O
weakest O
score O
is O
in O
the O
external O
reporting O
indicator O
. O

In O
the O
past O
, O
several O
observers O
have O
raised O
concerns O
about O
aggressive O
accounting O
at O
Starbucks B-ORG
but O
my O
analysis O
does O
not O
indicate O
any O
systematic O
current O
issues O
. O

The O
weak O
score O
is O
primarily O
the O
result O
of O
Starbucks B-ORG
current O
strategy O
of O
increasing O
equity O
ownership O
of O
several O
foreign O
subsidiaries O
. O

This O
is O
a O
strategic O
shift O
that O
has O
short-term O
costs O
and O
adds O
some O
uncertainty O
to O
the O
financial O
statements O
. O

Beyond O
the O
strong O
Organizational O
Indicator O
analysis O
, O
several O
additional O
factors O
favor O
Starbucks B-ORG
ability O
to O
continue O
to O
grow O
revenues O
. O

1 O
. O

Starbucks B-ORG
has O
little O
debt O
. O

Starbucks B-ORG
is O
not O
currently O
financing O
its O
growth O
with O
debt O
. O

Considering O
its O
growth O
, O
this O
is O
amazing O
. O

It O
also O
means O
that O
Starbucks B-ORG
has O
a O
large O
amount O
of O
flexibility O
in O
how O
it O
finances O
future O
growth O
. O

The O
company O
can O
assume O
much O
more O
debt O
without O
negatively O
affecting O
its O
risk O
profile O
because O
... O
2 O
. O

Starbucks B-ORG
has O
a O
healthy O
cashflow O
and O
current O
cash O
position O
. O

This O
allows O
the O
company O
to O
grow O
without O
debt O
. O

You O
could O
argue O
that O
Starbucks B-ORG
has O
too O
much O
cash O
and O
should O
do O
more O
to O
pass O
it O
on O
to O
shareholders O
. O

This O
option O
is O
another O
way O
that O
Starbucks B-ORG
has O
retained O
its O
flexibility O
for O
the O
future O
. O

3 O
. O

Starbucks B-ORG
is O
the O
primary O
owner O
of O
its O
stores O
and O
limits O
franchising O
. O

While O
Starbucks B-ORG
does O
partner O
( O
airlines O
, O
airports O
, O
Barnes B-ORG
& O
amp O
; O
Noble B-ORG
) O
, O
most O
of O
its O
stores O
are O
company O
owned O
. O

From O
a O
managerial O
perspective O
this O
greatly O
simplifies O
cost O
structures O
, O
product O
changes O
, O
and O
quality O
control O
. O

Taken O
together O
all O
of O
these O
factors O
paint O
a O
picture O
of O
a O
company O
with O
a O
very O
strong O
future O
. O

I O
can O
not O
say O
if O
these O
factors O
justify O
the O
current O
share O
price O
but O
I O
would O
say O
that O
they O
justify O
a O
higher O
P/E O
ratio O
than O
the O
industry O
norm O
. O

Risk O
is O
lower O
. O

Interesting O
aside O
: O
Starbucks B-ORG
is O
taking O
over O
the O
location O
in O
my O
town O
that O
was O
recently O
abandoned O
by O
Krispy B-ORG
Kreme I-ORG
. O

Disclosure O
: O
At O
the O
time O
of O
this O
writing O
I O
do O
not O
own O
Starbucks B-ORG
stock O
... O
but O
I O
am O
tempted O

some O

he O

Scott O
More O
than O
a O
few O
e-mails O
have O
come O
in O
wondering O
why O
I O
have O
n't O
remarked O
on O
the O
horrible O
hunting O
tragedy O
on O
Nov. O
21 O
that O
left O
six O
people O
dead O
, O
and O
why O
I O
have O
n't O
updated O
the O
ASSAULT O
WEAPONS O
BAN O
COUNTER O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
mean O
to O
wait O
this O
long O
and O
never O
intended O
to O
ignore O
the O
issue O
, O
but O
I O
have O
been O
extremely O
busy O
last O
week O
with O
Thanksgiving O
and O
everything O
that O
goes O
along O
with O
it O
. O

This O
is O
problem O
that O
needs O
to O
be O
addressed O
. O

But O
as O
for O
the O
assault O
weapons O
ban O
issue O
, O
the O
man O
accused O
of O
the O
brutal O
killings O
, O
Chai O
Vang O
of O
St B-LOC
. O

Paul B-LOC
, O
Minn B-LOC
, O
used O
a O
Russian-built B-LOC
Saiga O
7.62 O
mm O
, O
SKS O
semiautomatic O
rifle O
. O

As O
this O
article O
points O
out O
, O
the O
SKS O
was O
n't O
included O
on O
the O
list O
of O
banned O
weapons O
as O
part O
of O
the O
10-year O
ban O
on O
certain O
`` O
assault O
weapons O
'' O
signed O
by O
President O
Clinton O
. O

The O
ban O
expired O
in O
September O
and O
at O
the O
time O
of O
this O
posting O
, O
no O
one O
has O
been O
killed O
by O
any O
one O
of O
those O
weapons O
since O
the O
ban O
expired O
. O

But O
let O
's O
talk O
about O
this O
case O
, O
as O
I O
'm O
sure O
discussions O
have O
started O
and O
many O
want O
stronger O
gun O
control O
because O
of O
this O
freak O
incident O
. O

While O
the O
media O
use O
words O
like O
`` O
military O
style O
, O
'' O
`` O
assault O
'' O
and O
'' O
semiautomatic O
, O
'' O
the O
gun O
used O
in O
the O
slayings O
was O
not O
unlike O
a O
typical O
hunting O
rifle O
. O

The O
SKS O
is O
a O
medium-powered O
carbine O
equipped O
with O
a O
10-round O
magazine O
, O
just O
like O
the O
pistol O
I O
'm O
displaying O
in O
the O
photo O
on O
the O
left O
hand O
side O
of O
this O
blog O
. O

Banned O
weapons O
had O
capacities O
of O
more O
than O
10 O
rounds O
; O
so O
like O
my O
small O
9mm O
, O
the O
SKS O
was O
not O
classified O
as O
an O
`` O
assault O
'' O
weapon O
. O

So O
let O
's O
not O
center O
our O
discussion O
around O
the O
gun O
, O
let O
's O
talk O
about O
the O
person O
behind O
the O
trigger O
. O

If O
convicted O
of O
the O
killings O
, O
Vang O
faces O
life O
in O
prison O
as O
Minnesota B-LOC
does O
not O
honor O
the O
death O
penalty O
. O

I O
look O
forward O
to O
Vang O
's O
conviction O
and O
I O
pray O
for O
the O
families O
of O
the O
victims O
. O

What O
happened O
was O
indefensible O
and O
justice O
must O
be O
served O

own O
little O

not O
allow O
a O
second O
American-backed B-LOC
resolution O
to O
pass O
the O
United B-ORG
Nations I-ORG
Security O

President O
Bush O
wants O
the O
Security O
Council O
to O
explicitly O
authorize O

against O
Iraq B-LOC
, O
and O
his O
press O
secretary O
today O
remained O
optimistic O
that O
in O
the O
end O

that O
's O
just O
what O
he O
'll O
get O

President O
Bush O
is O
said O
to O
be O
focusing O
on O
one O
fence-sitting O
Security O
Council O
member O
, O
the O
African B-LOC
nation O
of O

because O
he O
said O

`` O

So O

OK O

that O
up O

He O
did O

TUCKER O
CARLSON O
, O
CNN O
CO-HOST O
Well O
, O
I O
suspected O
that O
. O

You O
know O
... O
BEGALA O
But O
they O
are O
a O
swing O
vote O
. O

Guinea B-LOC
is O
an O
important O
swing O
vote O
. O

CARLSON O
As O
is O
Cameroon B-LOC
. O

France B-LOC
and O
Germany B-LOC
are O
pointing O
to O
inspection O
and O
saying O
, O
Look O
, O
they O
're O
working O
. O

We O
do O
n't O
need O
war O
. O

They O
're O
not O
pointing O
out O
that O
inspections O
are O
working O
only O
because O
there O
's O
the O
credible O
threat O
of O
war O
. O

Saddam O
would O
n't O
be O
destroying O
missiles O
unless O
he O
thought O
he O
was O
going O
to O
be O
destroyed O
if O
he O
did O
n't O
. O

BEGALA O
I O
think O
that O
's O
a O
good O
point O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
mean O
we O
have O
to O
go O
to O
war O
. O

But O
I O
think O
President O
Bush O
should O
get O
credit O
for O
pushing O
to O
instructions O
and O
backing O
them O
up O
with O
the O
threat O
of O
force O
. O

CARLSON O
It O
means O
when O
you O
take O
the O
threat O
of O
force O
of O
the O
table O
, O
you O
're O
likely O
to O
stop O
disarming O
Saddam O
Hussein O
. O

BEGALA O
Yes O
, O
I O
'm O
not O
saying O
take O
the O
threat O
of O
force O
. O

I O
'm O
saying O
we O
do O
n't O
need O
to O
use O
force O
right O
now O
. O

CARLSON O
Well O
, O
France B-LOC
and O
Germany B-LOC
would O
like O
to O
. O

Secretary O
of O
State O
Colin O
Powell O
today O
responded O
to O
Saddam O
Hussein O

latest O
attempts O
to O
fool O
the O

Powell O
called O
Iraqi B-LOC
steps O
toward O
disarmament O
-- O
quote O
-- O
`` O
too O
little O
, O
too O
late O
'' O
gestures O
, O
meant O
to O
split O
international O
resolve O
to O
force O
Baghdad B-LOC
to O
give O
up O
its O
weapons O
of O
mass O
destruction O
. O

U.S B-LOC
. O

intelligence O
said O
Powell O
indicates O
Iraq B-LOC
has O
hidden O
equipment O
to O
produce O
al-Samoud O
2 O
missiles O
, O
even O
as O
it O
destroys O
existing O
ones O
, O
missiles O
that O
until O
recently O
, O
it O
claimed O
not O
to O
have O
. O

Powell O
also O
revealed O
that O
Iraq B-LOC
is O
hiding O
chemical O
and O
biological O
weapons O
in O
poor O
neighborhoods O
around O
Baghdad B-LOC
. O

In O
order O
to O
secure O
peace O
, O
Powell O
concluded O
, O
the O
international O
community O
must O
confront O
Saddam O
Hussein O
's O
refusal O
to O
disarm O
-- O
quote O
-- O
`` O
here O
and O
now O
. O
'' O

So O
, O
there O
you O
have O
it O
. O

The O
essence O
of O
the O
American B-LOC
case O
for O
war O
against O
Saddam O
Hussein O
. O

The O
only O
question O
left O
: O
who O
do O
you O
believe O
? O

Secretary O
of O
State O
Colin O
Powell O
or O
France B-LOC
? O

BEGALA O
No O
, O
the O
question O
is O
... O
CARLSON O
That O
is O
the O
question O
. O

BEGALA O
Who O
do O
you O
believe O
: O
the O
Bush O
administration O
or O
your O
lying O
eyes O
? O

We O
are O
watching O
them O
destroy O
weapons O
, O
as O
the O
president O
says O
, O
Oh O
, O
that O
's O
just O
a O
hoax O
. O

CARLSON O
But O
Paul O
... O
BEGALA O
They O
are O
disarming O
. O

CARLSON O
No O
, O
no O
, O
no O
that O
's O
not O
what O
the O
president O
's O
saying O
. O

He O
's O
saying O
, O
the O
-- O
it O
's O
a O
hoax O
to O
the O
extent O
that O
those O
are O
only O
a O
small O
number O
of O
the O
weapons O
there O
. O

Keep O
in O
mind O
, O
these O
are O
weapons O
that O
Saddam O
Hussein O
, O
until O
recently O
, O
said O
he O
did O
n't O
even O
have O
. O

He O
's O
a O
liar O
. O

BEGALA O
Of O
course O
. O

CARLSON O
And O
to O
trust O
Saddam O
Hussein O
in O
effort O
to O
disarm O
him O
-- O
foolish O
task O
, O
do O
n't O
you O
think O
? O

BEGALA O
Absolutely O
. O

Nobody O
trusts O
Saddam O
Hussein O
. O

The O
question O
is O
, O
Is O
he O
a O
sufficient O
threat O
to O
America B-LOC
today O
to O
risk O
the O
lives O
of O
our O
young O
men O
and O
women O
. O

CARLSON O
That O
's O
a O
separate O
question O
. O

That O
's O
a O
very O
separate O
question O
. O

BEGALA O
I O
think O
he O
's O
not O
. O

I O
think O
the O
inspections O
can O
work O
. O

CARLSON O
That O
's O
a O
different O
argument O
. O

We O
can O
take O
it O
up O

David O

Blair O

became O
divided O
over O
what O
a O

the O
United B-ORG

play O
in O
postwar O

when O

After O
the O
Camp O

talks O
, O
Blair O
, O
who O
analysts O
say O
has O
been O
pursuing O
a O
special O
relationship O
with O

to O
restore O
Britain's B-LOC
traditional O
role O
as O
a O
transatlantic O
`` O
bridge O
'' O
, O
was O
forced O
to O
readjust O
his O
tone O
. O

Blair O
and O
Bush O
were O
expected O
to O
bridge O
their O
gap O
on O
the O
issue O
by O
reaching O
an O
agreement O
on O
UN B-ORG
role O
in O
post-war O
Iraq B-LOC
, O
some O
analysts O
said O
even O
before O
this O
summit O
at O
Hillsborough B-LOC

south O
of O
Belfast B-LOC
, O
the O
second O
of O
its O

broke O
out O
on O
March O

In O
a O
joint O

statement O
, O
the O
two O

an O
`` O

`` O
We O

the O

The O

a O
`` O

in O
the O
effort O
to O
repair O

infrastructure O
, O
Blair O
told O
reporters O
at O
a O
news O
conference O
after O
his O
talks O
with O
Bush O
, O
downplaying O
UN B-ORG
role O
in O
emphasizing O
that O
ultimately O
the O
country O
must O
be O
run O
by O
the O
Iraqi B-LOC
people O
. O

`` O
The O
key O
is O
that O

should O
be O
governed O
by O
the O

, O
'' O
Blair O
said O
, O
pledging O
that O
British B-LOC

forces O
would O
not O
stay O
in O
the O
country O
`` O
a O
day O
longer O
than O
necessary O
'' O
. O

It O
was O
a O
`` O
false O
choice O
'' O
to O
debate O
whether O
Iraq B-LOC
should O
be O
run O
by O
coalition O
forces O
or O
the O
United B-ORG
Nations I-ORG
, O
said O
Blair O
, O
who O
was O
believed O
to O
be O
in O
favor O
of O
a O
stronger O
UN B-ORG
role O
in O
post-conflict O
Iraq B-LOC
than O
Bush O
. O

Echoing O
Blair O
, O
Bush O
said O
the O
UN B-ORG
would O
play O
a O
role O
in O
all O
aspects O
of O
post-war O
Iraq B-LOC
, O
from O
humanitarian O
aid O
to O
a O
future O
interim O
authority O
, O
adding O
that O
Iraq B-LOC
would O
`` O
move O

to O
an O
interim O
authority O
made O
up O
of O
Iraqis O
from O
inside O
and O
outside O
the O
country O
. O

However O
, O
when O
pressed O
on O
what O
precisely O
the O
UN B-ORG
role O
would O
be O
, O
Bush O
on O
Tuesday O
mentioned O
only O
humanitarian O
work O
, O
`` O
suggesting O
'' O
people O
to O
staff O
the O
interim O
authority O
and O
helping O
Iraq B-LOC
`` O

'' O

`` O
When O
we O
say O

we O
mean O

whether O
it O

up O

people O
will O
decide O
who O

on O
the O
Iraqi B-LOC
interim O
authority O
, O
'' O
said O
Bush O
. O

Bush O
did O
not O
spell O
out O
how O
much O
power O
the O
United B-ORG
Nations I-ORG
would O
have O
, O
nor O
did O
he O
elaborate O
on O
Washington B-LOC
's O
plans O
to O
place O
US B-LOC
officials O
alongside O
Iraqis O
in O
the O
interim O
administration O
. O

Differences O
still O
remain O
between O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
and O
Britain B-LOC
, O
analysts O
said O
, O
over O
the O
speed O
with O
which O
Iraq B-LOC
should O
be O
handed O
to O
an O
interim O
Iraqi B-LOC
administration O
, O
and O
the O
extent O
to O
which O
a O
US-led B-LOC
group O
of O
generals O
and O
former O
diplomats O
should O
effectively O
run O
the O
country O
. O

Yet O
, O
analysts O
argued O
, O
both O
Britain B-LOC
and O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
hope O
their O
agreed O
vision O
of O
a O
postwar O
scenario O
will O
placate O
anti-war O
nations O
such O
as O
France B-LOC
, O
Germany B-LOC
and O
Russia B-LOC
. O

`` O
We O
will O
move O
as O
quickly O
as O
possible O
to O
place O
governmental O

under O
the O
control O
of O

composed O
of O

'' O
Bush O
vowed O
at O
the O

adding O
that O

by O
the O
Iraqi B-LOC

`` O
Rebuilding O

pleaded O
the O

to O
avoid O
`` O

in O

On O
the O
unresolved O
dispute O
between O
Europe B-LOC

analysts O
say O
, O
Blair O
might O
again O
have O
to O
make O
a O
difficult O
choice O
, O
but O
he O
is O
very O
likely O
to O
support O

why O
I O
never O

On O
Saturday O
we O
hosted O
what O
was O
for O
the O
most O

a O
largely O
successful O
Halloween O

save O
for O

fake O

a O

the O
expected O
trashing O

areas O

Naturally O
, O
I O
dressed O
up O
as O

took O
the O

In O

the O

once O
again O

almost O
took O
us O

because O
( O
1 O
) O
there O
is O
little O
agreement O
about O
how O
to O
measure O
social O
responsibility O
and O
( O
2 O
) O
many O
current O
measures O
toss O
together O
a O
heap O
of O
information O
that O
has O
no O
business O
being O
lumped O
together O
. O

Social O
responsibility O
often O
includes O
everything O
from O
treatment O
of O
employees O
to O
type O
of O
product O
produced O
. O

There O
is O
not O
really O
any O
reason O
to O
believe O
that O
selling O
guns O
or O
tobacco O
has O
anything O
to O
do O
with O
forcing O
employees O
to O
work O
unpaid O
overtime O
. O

Yet O
both O
get O
lumped O
together O
in O
the O
socially O
responsible O
investing O
discussion O
. O

Once O
you O
start O
to O
break O
apart O
social O
responsibility O
into O
its O
various O
components O
, O
you O
start O
to O
see O
the O
valuable O
information O
. O

Companies O
that O
have O
poor O
employee O
relations O
tend O
to O
underperform O
, O
as O
do O
companies O
that O
pollute O
at O
a O
higher O
rate O
than O
their O
industry O
peers O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
companies O
with O
numerous O
NLRB B-ORG
violations O
do O
n't O
do O
worse O
than O
their O
peers O
and O
companies O
that O
sell O
your O
typical O
`` O
sin O
'' O
products O
( O
tobacco O
, O
firearms O
, O
gambling O
) O
can O
be O
excellent O
investments O
. O

Lump O
all O
these O
things O
together O
and O
of O
course O
you O
will O
get O
mixed O
results O
. O

Taken O
separately O
, O
they O
provide O
valuable O
information O
about O
future O
firm O
performance O
. O

I O
guess O
it O
is O
time O
to O
get O
beyond O
the O
image O
of O
the O
greedy O
capitalist O
vs. O
hippie O

that O

that O
`` O

to O
the O

, O
that O

technically O
accurate O

But O
the O
point O
of O
these O

is O
to O
align O
the O
price O
of O
a O

with O
the O
cost O
to O
society O

inasmuch O
as O
these O

they O

they O

the O
policy O
of O
making O

pay O
to O
compensate O
society O
for O
the O

they O

a O

Kofi's O

is O
soooooo O
impressive O

Gag O

Guess O
the O

own O

Why O
would O
an O

Public O
Radio B-ORG
) O
take O
money O
from O

? O

Perhaps O
because O
longtime O

Tom O
Brokaw O
put O
his O
stamp O
of O
approval O
on O
the O
UNA-USA B-ORG

acting O

Not O
surprisingly O
, O
Brokaw O
is O
listed O
on O
the O
Fasulo O

as O
saying O
it O
is O
a O
`` O
must-read O

'' O

Another O

of O
the O

a O
Ted O

online O

that O
covers O
the O
U.N B-ORG
. O

A O
fascinating O
part O
of O
the O
book O
is O
how O
Fasulo O
manages O
to O
gloss O
over O
Annan O
's O
role O
in O
the O
1994 O
genocide O
in O
Rwanda B-LOC
. O

She O
tries O
to O
blame O
the O
U.S B-LOC
. O

and O
other O
members O
of O
the O
Security B-ORG
Council I-ORG
for O
not O
sending O
enough O
troops O
to O
stop O
it O
. O

She O
admits O
, O
however O
, O
that O
, O
`` O
The O
Rwanda B-LOC
massacres O
occurred O
while O
Annan O
was O
U.N B-ORG
. O

Undersecretary O
General O
for O
peacekeeping O
, O
'' O
and O
that O
`` O
After O
he O
became O
SG O
[ O
Secretary O
General O
] O
, O
Annan O
commissioned O
a O
report O
to O
examine O
what O
had O
happened O
and O
suggest O
remedies O
. O
'' O

Later O
, O
`` O
Annan O
accepted O
responsibility O
for O
failing O
to O
act O
more O
quickly O
, O
'' O
she O
writes O
. O

But O
responsibility O
for O
what O
? O

The O
truth O
is O
that O
, O
as O
director O
of O
U.N B-ORG
. O

peacekeeping O
, O
Annan O
personally O
refused O
requests O
to O
authorize O
U.N B-ORG
. O

peacekeepers O
in O
Rwanda B-LOC
to O
seize O
weapons O
and O
prevent O
genocide O
. O

Writer O
and O
author O
Philip O
Gourevitch O
has O
described O
in O
detail O
how O
, O
three O
months O
before O
the O
genocide O
, O
Major O
General O
Romeo O
Dallaire O
, O
the O
commander O
of O
several O
thousand O
U.N B-ORG
. O

troops O
in O
Rwanda B-LOC
, O
sent O
a O
fax O
to O
Kofi O
Annan O
's O
office O
, O
saying O
he O
had O
received O
evidence O
from O
a O
Rwandan B-LOC
government O
informant O
that O
genocide O
was O
being O
planned O
. O

The O
informant O
offered O
to O
help O
U.N B-ORG
. O

forces O
in O
raiding O
the O
government O
stockpiles O
to O
be O
used O
in O
the O
genocide O
campaign O
. O

All O
that O
the O
informant O
wanted O
in O
return O
was O
protection O
for O
himself O
and O
his O
family O
. O

But O
the O
general O
needed O
U.N B-ORG
. O

authorization O
to O
conduct O
such O
a O
raid O
and O
save O
lives O
. O

He O
asked O
for O
that O
approval O
but O
the O
answer O
came O
back O
in O
a O
now-infamous O
`` O
genocide O
fax O
'' O
from O
Annan O
's O
office O
. O

It O
denied O
authorization O
for O
the O
mission O
and O
told O
him O
that O
he O
should O
turn O
the O
information O
provided O
by O
the O
confidential O
witness O
over O
to O
the O
Rwandan B-LOC
government O
which O
was O
planning O
the O
genocide O
! O

The O
result O
was O
that O
the O
information O
dried O
up O
and O
the O
genocide O
took O
place O
. O

Yup O
, O
good O
ole O
Kofi O
told O
this O
poor O
guy O
to O
give O
the O
secret O
info O
over O
to O
the O
very O
government O
that O
was O
planning O
the O
genocide O

What O
a O
great O

he O
is O

he O
. O

Or O
how O
about O
the O
ongoing O
prostitution O
that O
's O
going O
on O
in O

Now O
the O
report O
comes O
out O

issued O

that O

to O
some O

its O
role O

for O
five O

WASHINGTON B-LOC
( O
AP B-ORG
) O
With O
opposition O
hardening O
, O
the O
White B-LOC
House I-LOC
left O
open O
the O
possibility O
Tuesday O
that O
it O
would O
not O
seek O
a O
United B-ORG
Nations I-ORG
vote O
on O
its O
war-making O
resolution O
if O
the O
measure O
was O
headed O
for O
defeat O
. O

`` O
The O
vote O
is O
desirable O
. O

It O
is O
not O
necessary O
, O
'' O
presidential O
spokesman O
Ari O
Fleischer O
said O
. O

The O
comments O
came O
as O
President O
George O
W. O
Bush O
and O
his O
advisers O
looked O
beyond O
the O
diplomatic O
showdown O
and O
made O
plans O
for O
a O
public O
relations O
buildup O
to O
potential O
war O
. O

One O
option O
under O
serious O
consideration O
was O
Bush O
giving O
Iraqi B-LOC
leader O
Saddam O
Hussein O
a O
final O
ultimatum O
, O
perhaps O
with O
a O
short-term O
deadline O
, O
in O
a O
major O
address O
next O
week O
, O
two O
senior O
White B-LOC
House I-LOC
officials O
said O
. O

The O
officials O
, O
who O
spoke O
on O
condition O
of O
anonymity O
, O
stressed O
that O
a O
variety O
of O
options O
are O
on O
the O
table O
and O
they O
all O
depend O
on O
the O
outcome O
of O
a O
U.N B-ORG
. O

Security O
Council B-ORG
debate O
on O
the O
U.S.-backed B-LOC
war O
resolution O
. O

The O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
still O
does O
n't O
have O
the O
nine O
votes O
needed O
to O
win O
approval O
of O
the O
resolution O
, O
according O
to O
supporters O
and O
opponents O
, O
and O
many O
undecided O
council O
members O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
compromise O
. O

Even O
if O
he O
gets O
the O
required O
votes O
, O
Bush O
needs O
to O
avoid O
a O
veto O
by O
Russia B-LOC
, O
France B-LOC
or O
China B-LOC
who O
all O
favor O
continuing O
inspections O
at O
least O
into O
July O
. O

Once O
the O
vote O
is O
resolved O
one O
way O
or O
another O
, O
Bush O
will O
intensify O
his O
case O
for O
war O
, O
officials O
said O
, O
barring O
unforeseen O
events O
such O
as O
Saddam O
suddenly O
disarming O
or O
going O
into O
exile O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
a O
possible O
address O
, O
they O
have O
discussed O
a O
presidential O
news O
conference O
and O
a O
Cabinet O
meeting O
as O
ways O
for O
Bush O
to O
communicate O
his O
plans O
to O
the O
nation O
next O
week O
. O

As O
those O
discussions O
were O
taking O
place O
behind O
the O
scenes O
, O
Fleischer O
told O
reporters O
that O
Turkey B-LOC
would O
lose O
a O
proposed O
$ O
15 O
billion O
aid O
package O
unless O
it O
admits O
troops O
into O
the O
country O
for O
the O
Iraq B-LOC
conflict O
. O

`` O
The O
particular O
package O
that O
we O
've O
been O
talking O
to O
them O
about O
was O
predicated O
on O
assistance O
and O
cooperation O
in O
any O
plan O
for O
the O
use O
of O
force O
against O
Iraq B-LOC
, O
'' O
Fleischer O
said O
. O

Until O
Tuesday O
, O
the O
spokesman O
had O
suggested O
part O
of O
the O
package O
would O
be O
available O
to O
Turkey B-LOC
regardless O
of O
whether O
62,000 O
American B-LOC
troops O
are O
allowed O
in O
the O
country O
. O

White B-LOC
House I-LOC
officials O
said O
they O
were O
turning O
up O
pressure O
on O
Turkey B-LOC
in O
hopes O
that O
the O
parliament O
would O
grant O
the O
U.S B-LOC
. O

request O
on O
a O
second O
vote O
. O

Even O
so O
, O
officials O
said O
future O
aid O
for O
Turkey B-LOC
would O
not O
be O
ruled O
out O
, O
just O
the O
massive O
package O
under O
consideration O
now O
. O

At O
the O
United B-ORG
Nations I-ORG
, O
Secretary-General O
Kofi O
Annan O
called O
Baghdad's B-LOC
missile O
destruction O
`` O
a O
positive O
development O
, O
'' O
putting O
him O
at O
odds O
with O
Bush O
's O
assessment O
. O

Russia B-LOC
's O
Foreign O
Minister O
Igor O
Ivanov O
, O
hardening O
Moscow B-LOC
's O
opposition O
to O
quick O
military O
action O
, O
indicated O
Russia B-LOC
may O
use O
its O
veto O
against O
the O
U.S.-backed B-LOC
resolution O
. O

Both O
developments O
further O
complicated O
Bush O
's O
efforts O
to O
win O
passage O
of O
the O
resolution O
, O
adding O
significance O
to O
talk O
of O
what O
the O
administration O
would O
do O
if O
U.N B-ORG
. O

opposition O
cements O
against O

position O

`` O
The O

Fleischer O
said O

`` O

'' O

`` O

'' O
Fleischer O
said O

U.S B-LOC
. O

Ambassador O
John O
Negroponte O
was O
asked O
whether O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
would O
withdraw O
the O
resolution O
if O
it O
did O
n't O
have O
the O
votes O
to O
pass O
it O
. O

`` O
We O
have O
n't O
crossed O
that O

, O
'' O
he O
said O

`` O

Afterward O

Congressman O
Bob O

, O
Republican O
of O
California B-LOC

BEGALA O
Bob O
, O
one O
of O
the O
reasons O
I O
think O
so O
many O
Americans O
are O
worried O
about O
this O
war O
and O
so O
many O
people O
around O
the O
world O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
go O
is O
there O
have O
been O
a O
lot O
of O
problems O
with O
credibility O
from O
this O
administration O
. O

Our O
president O
has O
repeatedly O
, O
for O
example O
, O
relied O
on O
a O
man O
whom O
you O
're O
aware O
, O
Hussein O
Kamel O
, O
Saddam O
Hussein O
's O
son-in-law O
, O
leader O
of O
the O
Iraq B-LOC
arms O
program O
who O
defected O
for O
a O
time O
. O

And O
gave O
us O
a O
whole O
lot O
of O
information O
and O
then O
went O
home O
and O
his O
father-in-law O
killed O
him O
. O

Bad O
move O
. O

But O
while O
he O
was O
here O
, O
he O
gave O
us O
a O
whole O
lot O
of O
information O
. O

Gave O
us O
a O
whole O
lot O
of O
information O
. O

Well O
, O
our O
president O
told O
us O
that O
information O
proves O
that O
the O
dictator O
had O
chemical O
weapons O
, O
which O
is O
true O
. O

But O
what O
we O
just O
learned O
this O
week O
from O
`` O
Newsweek B-ORG
'' O
magazine B-ORG
which O
got O
a O
hold O
of O
the O
debriefings O
, O
is O
that O
he O
also O
told O
us O
it O
was O
destroyed O
back O
in O
1995 O
. O

Why O
has O
n't O
our O
president O
told O
us O
that O
? O

Why O
do O
we O
have O
to O
learn O
it O
from O
'' O
Newsweek B-ORG
'' O
? O

DORNAN O
I O
do O
n't O
believe O
that O
he O
believed O
it O
was O
all O
destroyed O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
this O
guy O
was O
such O
an O
idiot O
to O
go O
back O
and O
let O
his O
father-in-law O
kill O
him O
shows O
he O
was O
n't O
the O
most O
stable O
of O
people O
. O

But O
the O
things O
that O
... O
BEGALA O
Good O
point O
. O

But O
should O
n't O
our O
president O
have O
told O
us O
what O
the O
CIA B-ORG
told O
him O
. O

Why O
do O
we O
learn O
from O
`` O
Newsweek B-ORG
? O

`` O
Should O
he O
level O
with O
us O
? O

DORNAN O
Paul O
, O
look O
, O
the O
problem O
is O
I O
would O
stipulate O
all O
four O
of O
us O
hates O
war O
. O

Any O
rational O
person O
hates O
war O
. O

Bush O
is O
n't O
sitting O
in O

White O

not O
thinking O

Let O
me O
tell O
you O

what O

to O
Walter O

, O
that O

thought O
up O

it O
pertains O
to O

in O
a O

if O
he O
can O

the O
hold O
of O
the O
means O
to O
do O
it O
. O

NOVAK O
Tom O

I O
think O
we O
all O
realize O
that O
a O
government O
does O
n't O
go O
to O
war O
a O
nation O
goes O
to O
war O
. O

And O
so O
I O
would O
like O
you O
to O
take O
a O
look O
at O
the O
CNN/ B-ORG
'' O
USA B-ORG

But O

ask O
them O
another O
question O

ask O
them O
what O
they O
think O
about O
spending O
$ O
1.3 O

about O

just O
a O

an O

about O

The O
old O
wedding O
problem O
Two O
of O
my O
nephews O
were O
excluded O
from O
their O
brother O
's O
wedding O
this O
weekend O
because O
they O
are O
not O
LDS B-ORG
. O

Of O
interest O
, O
neither O
went O
to O
the O
reception O
either O
. O

Both O
were O
extremely O
hurt O
, O
particularly O
since O
they O
know O
their O
brother O
could O
have O
had O
a O
civil O
ceremony O
and O
then O
been O
married O
in O
the O
temple O
later O
. O

I O
was O
offended O
because O
one O
of O
those O
nephews O
and O
I O
are O
very O
close O
, O
and O
he O
was O
really O
upset O
. O

The O
groom O
said O
`` O
it O
was O
n't O
quite O
what O
I O
had O
expected O
. O
'' O

The O
bride O
is O
not O
quite O
able O
to O
speak O
in O
front O
of O
strangers O
, O
so O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
she O
thought O
. O

She O
did O
tell O
my O
niece O
that O
she O
thought O
her O
husband O
was O
a O
good O
catch O
-- O
RM O
attending O
BYU B-ORG
and O
all O
that O
. O

I O
got O
a O
sort O
of O
an O
icky O
feeling O
when O
I O
realized O
the O
only O
people O
who O
did O
attend O
the O
kid O

wedding O
was O
his O
unmedicated O
bi-polar O
mother O
and O
his O

who O

Re O
: O
The O
old O
wedding O
problem O
That O
's O
sad O
, O
Lee O
. O

I O
really O
think O
it O
's O
time O
for O
the O
church O
to O
admit O
that O
a O
civil O
ceremony O
followed O
by O
a O
temple O
sealing O
reaches O
the O
same O
goal O
, O
often O
in O
a O
more O
loving O
way O
, O
than O
insisting O
that O
only O
the O
sealing O
is O
worth O
doing O
. O

A O
change O
of O
that O
sort O
would O
be O
very O
simple O
to O
implement O
, O
and O
most O
church O
members O
would O
like O
it O
better O
than O
allowing O
non-LDS B-ORG
family O
members O
into O
the O
temple O
, O
which O
would O
actually O
be O
my O
preference O
. O

There O
's O
been O
a O
thread O
recently O
in O
one O
of O
the O
exMo O
fora O
about O
a O
woman O
whose O
bishop O
, O
who O
she O
had O
been O
planning O
to O
have O
marry O
her O
, O
was O
going O
out O
of O
town O
, O
so O
she O
asked O
the O
stake O
president O
, O
who O
she O
did O
n't O
know O
well O
. O

He O
insisted O
that O
he O
needed O
to O
make O
the O
point O
, O
as O
part O
of O
performing O
the O
ceremony O
, O
that O
she O
really O
needed O
to O
be O
married O
in O
the O
temple O
, O
even O
though O
her O
fiance O
was O
not O
LDS B-ORG
. O

She O
ultimately O
declined O
his O
services O
. O

How O
to O
get O
the O
message O
across O
to O
young O
people O
that O
considering O
the O
feelings O
of O
their O
family O
is O
just O
as O
important O
as O
being O
sealed O
for O
time O
and O
all O
eternity O
? O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

It O
would O
have O
to O
be O
some O
sort O
of O
grassroots O
movement O
, O
I O
think O
, O
since O
it O
's O
not O
likely O
to O
come O
through O
official O
, O
correlated O
channels O
. O

Re O
: O
The O
old O
wedding O
problem O
*shrugs* O
I O
chose O
to O
have O
a O
civil O
ceremony O
largely O
because O
my O
wife O
and O
I O
were O
both O
converts O
and O
a O
temple O
ceremony O
would O
have O
excluded O
both O
families O
completely O
. O

From O
a O
family O
standpoint O
it O
sounded O
liek O
a O
good O
decision O
, O
harmony O
and O
all O
that O
... O
plus O
the O
temple O
ceremony O
could O
be O
sealed O
a O
year O
later O
. O

Unfortunately O
we O
started O
off O
on O
the O
wrong O
foot O
for O
a O
lot O
of O
reasons O
and O
the O
marriage O
did O
n't O
last O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
help O
but O
wonder O
if O
perhaps O
we O
did O
ourselves O
a O
diservice O
by O
not O
getting O
sealedi O
ntially O
, O
and O
making O
our O
marriage O
a O
gospel O
focused O
one O
. O

Who O
's O
to O
say O
. O

It O
's O
a O
tough O
decision O
to O
make O
and O
despite O
the O
feeling O
I O
myself O
caved O
I O
feel O
people O
should O
be O
understanding O
of O
the O
rationale O
. O

For O
my O
part O
if O
we O
had O
been O
sealed O
intially O
there O
simply O
would O
n't O
have O
been O
ANYONE O
there O
and O
both O
our O
families O
had O
harsh O
feeligns O
about O
the O
church O
as O
is O
, O
and O
a O
sealign O
would O
have O
only O
created O
more O
disharmony O
. O

For O
my O
part O
though O
, O
I O
think O
we O
started O
the O
marriage O
with O
a O
compromise O
and O
deined O
ourselves O
tremendous O
blessing O
and O
ultimately O
paid O
the O
price O
. O

SEN. O
RICHARD O
LUGAR O
( O

, O
INDIANA O
No O
, O
I O
concur O
with O
Secretary O

, O
Secretary O
Rumsfeld O
, O
the O

, O
that O
weapons O

that O

What O

we O
may O
find O
them O
and O
what O

all O

else O

you O

And O
that O

I O

we O
have O
to O
be O
working O

who O
are O

you O

they O

SEN. O
CHRISTOPHER O
DODD O
( O
D O
) O
, O
CONNECTICUT O
I O
have O
no O
evidence O
to O
the O
contrary O
. O

And O
certainly O
, O
they O
have O
used O
them O
in O
the O
past O
. O

There O
's O
no O
doubt O
about O
that O
at O
all O
, O
both O
in O
Iran B-LOC
and O
against O
the O
Kurdish O
population O
. O

So O
, O
whether O
or O
not O
they O
find O
them O
in O
the O
exact O
form O
that O
many O
would O
assume O
they O
would O
be O
the O
case O
-- O
possibly O
some O
got O
out O
of O
the O
country O
. O

It O
would O
n't O
surprise O
me O
to O
hear O
that O
. O

But O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
work O
on O
the O
assumption O
, O
based O
on O
the O
intelligence O
that O
has O
been O
gathered O
, O
that O
the O
weapons O
of O
mass O
destruction O
existed O
. O

BLITZER O
What O
if O
they O
do O
n't O
? O

DODD O
Well O
, O
you O
know O
, O
they O
've O
used O
it O
in O
the O
past O
, O
and O
I O
think O
the O
point O
that O
Senator O
Lugar O
just O
made O
-- O
certainly O
having O
the O
intellectual O
capacity O
to O
do O
this O
was O
proven O
already O
by O
the O
fact O
they O
've O
used O
them O
in O
the O
past O
. O

So O
, O
I O
would O
n't O
dwell O
on O
that O
point O
specifically O
, O
because O
Saddam O
Hussein O
clearly O
was O
a O
producer O
and O
a O
user O
of O
biological O
and O
chemical O
weapons O
. O

He O
clearly O
was O
on O
the O
track O
to O
acquire O
a O
nuclear O
capacity O
, O
and O
the O
world O
is O
a O
safer O
place O
today O
because O
he O
's O
not O
ruling O
Iraq B-LOC
. O

BLITZER O
Will O
the O
U.S B-LOC

lose O
creditability O
, O
Mr. O
Chairman O
, O
if O
, O
if O
the O
U.S B-LOC
. O

finds O
no O
hard O
evidence O
, O
no O
so-called O
smoking O
gun O
? O

LUGAR O
No O
, O
we O
have O
full O
credibility O
in O
Iraq B-LOC
. O

We O
've O
prosecuted O
with O
the O
alliance O
a O
successful O
liberation O
of O
the O
Iraqi B-LOC
people O
, O
and O
we O
have O
clearly O
caused O
Saddam O
to O
destroy O
weapons O
of O
mass O
destruction O
, O
or O
at O
least O
to O
suppress O
evidence O
of O
them O
. O

That O
is O
a O
victory O
of O
sorts.This O
is O
a O
facet O
that's O
important O
. O

It O
's O
important O
in O
the O
war O
against O
terrorism O
that O
we O
rout O
out O
whatever O
is O
there O
and O
, O
likewise O
, O
the O
people O
involved O
, O
because O
they O
might O
help O
supply O
al B-ORG
Qaeda I-ORG
or O
other O
terrorists O
along O
the O
trail O
. O

BLITZER O
Senator O
Dodd O
, O
how O
important O
is O
it O
for O
the O
U.S B-LOC
. O

to O
conclusively O
learn O
what O
happened O
to O
Saddam O
Hussein O
? O

DODD O
Well O
, O
it O
's O
important O
. O

But O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
's O
as O
important O
as O
finding O
Osama O
bin O
Laden O
, O
for O
the O
simple O
reason O
that O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
Saddam O
Hussein O
today O
poses O
any O
threat O
, O
wherever O
he O
is O
. O

If O
he O
is O
alive O
, O
obviously O
, O
he O
does O
n't O
pose O
the O
kind O
of O
threat O
that O
an O
Osama O
bin O
Laden O
does O
with O
his O
cellular O
network O
around O
the O
world O
to O
reactivate O
al B-ORG
Qaeda I-ORG
and O
international O
terrorism O
. O

So O
, O
it O
would O
certainly O
be O
good O
to O
know O
where O
he O
is O
. O

It O
would O
be O
, O
certainly O
, O
to O
know O
, O
to O
apprehend O
him O
, O
to O
bring O
him O
before O
a O
court O
of O
justice O
. O

But O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
's O
absolutely O
critical O
for O
the O
ultimate O
success O
of O
this O
mission O
that O
we O
apprehend O
him O
or O
find O
out O
what O
happened O
to O
him O
. O

BLITZER O
And O

that O
assessment O

Mr. O

the O
United B-LOC

said O
Monday O
. O

Secretary O
of O
State O
Colin O
Powell O
said O
the O
offer O
was O
made O
during O
three-way O
talks O
between O
US B-LOC
, O
North B-LOC
Korean I-LOC
and O
Chinese B-LOC
diplomats O
last O
week O
in O
Beijing B-LOC

At O
the O

meeting O
Pyongyang B-LOC
confirmed O
it O
had O
nuclear O
weapons O
, O
and O
threatened O
to O
prove O
it O
with O
a O
`` O

'' O

`` O
The O
North O
Koreans O
acknowledged O
a O
number O
of O
things O
that O
they O
were O
doing O

in O

, O
said O
that O
these O
are O
now O
up O
for O
further O
discussion O
, O
'' O
he O
told O
reporters O
at O
the O
State B-ORG
Department I-ORG
. O

`` O
They O
did O
put O
forward O
a O
plan O
that O
would O
ultimately O
deal O
with O
their O
nuclear O
capability O
and O
their O
missile O
activities O
, O
but O
they O
, O
of O

, O
expect O
something O
considerable O
in O
return O
, O
'' O
Powell O
said O
. O

`` O
We O
are O
studying O
that O
plan O
, O
we O
are O
examining O
it O
with O
our O
friends O

'' O
Powell O
said O
, O
adding O
that O
talks O
were O
now O
underway O
with O
the O
South B-LOC
Korean I-LOC
, O
Japanese B-LOC
, O
Russian B-LOC
and O
Australian B-LOC
as O
well O
as O
other O
governments O
. O

`` O
It O
was O
useful O
to O

it O
all O
out O
on O
the O

where O
we O

from O
here O
, O
'' O
he O
said O
, O
referring O
to O
the O
April O
23 O
to O
25 O
discussions O
in O
Beijing B-LOC
. O

Powell O
gave O
no O
indication O
as O
to O
whether O
Washington B-LOC
would O
accept O
the O
offer O
, O
and O
did O
not O
address O
what O
Pyongyang B-LOC
was O
demanding O
in O
terms O
of O
concesssions O
. O

However O
other O
US B-LOC
officials O
said O
the O
North O
Koreans O
had O
presented O
a O
lengthy O
list O
of O
demands O
. O

The O
demands O
include O
full O
normalization O
of O
ties O
with O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
, O
security O
guarantees O
and O
economic O
assistance O
that O
include O
oil O

`` O
They O
had O
quite O
a O
list O
of O
things O
, O
'' O
State B-ORG
Department I-ORG
spokesman O
Richard O
Boucher O
told O
reporters O

Asked O
specifically O
about O
normalization O
of O
relations O
and O
economic O
assistance O
, O
Boucher O
replied O
: O
`` O
I O
do O
n't O
really O
quibble O
with O
that O
characterization O
of O
the O
list O
. O
'' O

A O
senior O
State B-ORG
Department I-ORG
official O
said O
later O
that O
the O
list O
of O
demands O
was O
so O
extensive O
that O
it O
defied O
a O
`` O
concise O
description O
. O
'' O

`` O
It O
basically O
listed O
everything O
they O
have O
ever O
asked O
for O
, O
'' O
the O
official O
told O
reporters O
on O
condition O
of O
anonymity O
, O
identifying O
oil O
and O
energy O
supplies O
as O
demands O
. O

Although O
the O
North B-LOC
Korean I-LOC
demands O
are O
being O
looked O
at O
, O
Boucher O
repeated O
long-standing O
US B-LOC
policy O
that O
Washington B-LOC
would O
not O
be O
blackmailed O
or O
otherwise O
threatened O
into O
buying O
Pyongyang B-LOC
off O

`` O
We O

'' O
he O
said O
. O

Powell O
acknowledged O
that O
North B-LOC
Korea I-LOC
had O
hinted O
it O
could O
prove O
it O
possessed O
nuclear O
weapons O
with O
some O
sort O
of O

during O
the O
Beijing B-LOC
talks O
, O
but O
maintained O
that O
the O
North O
Koreans O
had O
not O
used O
the O
words O
`` O

or O
`` O
testing O

`` O
They O
said O

another O

he O
said O

South B-LOC
Korean I-LOC
newspapers O
reported O
earlier O
Monday O
that O
the O
North B-LOC
suggested O
that O
Pyongyang B-LOC
and O
Washington B-LOC
act O
simultaneously O
and O
equally O
to O
resolve O
the O
six-month-old O
nuclear O
crisis O
. O

Boucher O
ruled O
out O
simultaneous O
steps O
by O
both O
sides O
, O
stressing O
that O
Washington B-LOC
would O
not O
consider O
such O
moves O

you O

th- O
I O

that O
they O
can O

because O
-- O
in O
California B-LOC

uh O
, O
the O

was O

, O
yeah O
. O

So O
, O
th- O
then O
an- O
B O
and O
they O
had O
a O
little O
bit O
about O
that O
at O
church O
last O
week O

when O
I O
went O
to O
church O
services O

or O
the O

I O
ca O
n't O

, O
um O
, O
it O
-- O
I O
kind O
of O
thought O
then O
-- O
that O
, O
uh O
, O
when O
I O
first O
heard O
about O
the O
case O
, O
let O
me O
just O
back O
up O
a O
little O
bit O
. O

A O
Yeah O
. O

B O
When O
I O
first O
-- O
heard O
the O
case O
, O
or O
about O
it O
, O
I O
-- O
told O
myself O
, O
if O
he O
did O
do O
it O
, O
A O
Yeah O
, O
he O
probably O
did O
. O

B O
and O
I O
think O
he O
did O
, O
A O
Yeah O
. O

B O
uh O
, O
if O
he O
did O
do O
it O
, O
I O
-- O
thought O
to O
myself O
, O
he O
will O
probably O
get O
-- O
the O
maximum O
sentence O
of O
whatever O
it O
is O
A O
Well O
, O
he O
he O
he O
probably O
will O
, O
yeah O
. O

B O
because O
of O
the O
baby O
A O
Yeah O
. O

B O
and O
, O
to O
me O
, O
I O
-- O
do O
n't O
believe O
even O
-- O
eh O
, O
exactly O
, O
you O
know O
, O
fetal O
state O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
that O
was O
a O
baby O
-- O
that O
could O
've O
lived O
. O

A O
Right O
, O
a O
human O
being O
, O
yeah O
. O

B O
So O
, O
to O
me O
, O
I O
would O
n't O
-- O
he- O
it O
wouldn't O
've O
been O
good O
if O
he O
-- O
if O
I O
had O
been O
on O
his O
jury O
. O

A O
Mm O
, O
yeah O
, O
I O
see O
what O
you O
mean O
. O

B O
I O
could O
never O
vote O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
to O
let O
him O
go O
. O

A O
Well O
, O
you O
know O
B O
I O
c- O
but O
, O
now O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
that O
I O
would O
vote O
for O
a O
death O
penalty O
because O
I O
'm O
not O
sure O
that O
a O
-- O
a O
death O
cancels O
out O
a O
death O
. O

A O
Right O
, O
yeah O
. O

B O
I O
'm O
not O
-- O
-- O
I O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
and O
-- O
I O
would O
n't O
really O
be O
able O
to O
vote O
-- O
on O
that O
because O
my O
father O
was O
killed O
at O
work O
. O

A O
Oh O
, O
I O
'm O
sorry O
to O
hear O
that O
. O

B O
So O
, O
you O
think O
you O
-- O
-- O
so O
, O
you O
know O
, O
I O
I O
've O
got O
two O
things O
that O
probably O
-- O
I O
would O
be O
disqualified O
on O
that O
kind O
of O
a O
jury O
. O

A O
Yeah O
, O
maybe O
so O
. O

B O
Well O
, O
I O
'm O
pretty O
sure O
of O
it O
. O

A O
Well O
, O
uh- O
B O
But O
, O
uh O
, O
believe O
it O
or O
not O
, O
I O
do O
still O
feel O
sorry O
for O
him O
A O
Uh O
, O
wh- O
yeah O
, O
I O
do O
too O
. O

I O
feel O
sorry O
for O
him O
. O

B O
because O
, O
uh O
, O
A O
He O
's O
going O
to O
be O
in O
the O
B O
more O
so O
for O
his O
family O
-- O
m- O
more O
so O
for O
both O
families O
-- O
because O
I O
know O
that O
from O
my O
own O
experience O
, O
we O
're O
the O
one O
's O
that O
are O
left O
. O

A O
Well O
, O
he O
's O
also O
being O
, O
uh O
, O
you O
know O
, O
dragged O
through O
, O
uh O
, O
the O

, O
you O
know O
, O
uh O
, O
B O
Now O

to O
to O
me O
that O

A O
the O
nation-wi- O
nation-wide O
med- O

You O

Eh O

about O

B O
Well O
, O
you O
know O
, O
you O
may O
think O
I O
'm O
a O
little O
-- O
crazy O
, O
but O
at O
first O
when O
I O
heard O
about O
, O
uh O
, O
Frey O
, O
when O
I O
first O
heard O
about O
her O
, O
I O
got O
worried O
that O
maybe O
it O
was O
-- O
both O
of O
them O
A O
No O
, O
yeah O
, O
may- O
B O
because O
they O
're O
-- O
I O
've O
never O
totally O
-- O
believed O
-- O
that O
Peterson O
did O
this O
all O
by O
himself O
. O

A O
She O
may O
have O
-- O
she O
may O
have O
, O
uh O
, O
planted O
the O
idea O
in O
his O
head O
, O
you O
know O
. O

B O
Yet O
something O
tells O
me O
, O
and O
-- O
I O
think O
-- O
that O
he O
actually O
-- O
was O
so O
involved O
her O
, O
th- O
Amber O
, O
A O
Yeah O
. O

B O
that O
if O
-- O
she O
had O
anything O
to O
do O
with O
this O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
he O
would O
ever O
tell O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
believe O
he O
would O
ever O
tell O
on O
her O
. O

A O
Yeah O
. O

Uh O
B O
There O
was O
the O
impression O
I O
got O
. O

I O
kind O
of O
, O
uh O
, O
watched O
him O
at O
different O
times O
when O
they O
would O
mention O
her O
A O
Yeah O
, O
he O
he O
seemed O
to O
be O
be O
very O
vili- O
he O
seemed O
to O
be O
most O
most O
un- O
at- O
eh O
, O
un-at-ease O
B O
and O
I O
just O
think O
that O
A O
when O
they O
were O
talking O
about O
Amber O
. O

B O
Right O
. O

A O
Yeah O
. O

Uh O
B O
And O
that O
caught O
my O
eye O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
it O
's O
because O
I O

a O

, O
um O
, O
I O
thought O

developing O

in O
recent O

officials O
at O

said O
that O
U.S B-LOC

satellites O
have O
identified O
a O
sophisticated O

nuclear O

site O
in O
an O
area O
called O

At O
the O
site O

equipment O

set O
up O

test O
conventional O

that O
, O
when O

, O
could O
compress O
a O
plutonium O

and O
set O

. O

[ O
oMa O
intelligence O
officials O
believe O
that O
the O
existence O
of O
the O

range O
is O
evidence O
that O
the O
country O
intends O
to O
manufacture O
much O
more O
sophisticated O

that O
would O
be O
light O
enough O
to O
put O
onto O
its O
growing O
arsenal O
of O
medium- O
and O
long-range O
missiles O
. O

Previously O
, O
U.S B-LOC

officials O
had O
said O
they O
were O
uncertain O
whether O
North B-LOC

had O
received O
enough O
outside O
technical O
help O
to O
even O
attempt O
to O
make O
such O
a O
`` O
miniaturized O
'' O
nuclear O

The O
new O

would O
suggest O
that O
the O
North O

are O
getting O

now O
, O

say O
they O
could O
do O
in O

as O
little O
as O
a O

less O

But O
officials O
say O
there O
is O
no O
sure O
way O
of O
knowing O
that O
they O
can O
until O
they O
actually O
test O

Senior O

it O
requires O
a O
unified O

to O

. O

The O
new O
intelligence O
is O
apparently O
being O
marshaled O
to O
support O
the O
administration O

argument O
. O

According O
to O
officials O
who O
have O
been O
briefed O
on O
the O
U.S B-LOC
. O

reports O
, O
conventional O
explosions O
simulating O
a O
nuclear O

at O
the O

site O
, O
which O
is O
near O
North B-LOC
Korea I-LOC

main O
nuclear O
complex O
. O

North B-LOC
Korea I-LOC
has O
never O
tested O
a O
nuclear O
weapon O
, O
though O
the O
CIA B-ORG
long O
ago O
estimated O
that O
it O
manufactured O
two O
crude O
devices O
in O
the O
late O
1980s O
or O
early O
1990s O

North B-LOC
Korea I-LOC

unlike O
Iraq B-LOC

has O
made O
no O
secret O
of O
its O
plan O

Now O
, O

five O

six O

some O
of O

intently O
since O
late O
last O
year O

when O
the O

Those O

had O
stood O
guard O
over O
a O
collection O
of O
8,000 O
spent O
nuclear O
fuel O
rods O
, O
which O
can O
be O
reprocessed O
into O
weapons-grade O
plutonium O

In O
January O
the O
country O
began O
to O
re-start O
its O
nuclear O
rexrOgessing O

which O
had O
been O
mothballed O
for O
nearly O
a O
decade O
under O
a O
1994 O
agreement O
with O
the O
Clinton O
administration O
. O

But O
according O
to O
U.S B-LOC

officials O
, O
it O
now O
appears O
that O
North B-LOC
Korean I-LOC
engineers O
ran O
into O
technical O
problems O
in O
restarting O

. O

While O
intelligence O
officials O
have O
reached O
no O
consensus O
, O
they O
told O

last O

that O
in O
the O
worst O
case O
, O
only O
a O
few O
hundred O
of O
the O
8,000 O
rods O
had O
been O
converted O
into O
plutonium O

It O
would O
take O
1,000 O
to O
1,500 O
rods O
to O
make O
enough O
plutonium O
for O
a O
weapon O
, O
experts O
say.O O
`` O
What O
we O
are O
told O
is O
that O
it O
would O
take O
perhaps O
six O
months O
after O

produce O
a O
miniaturized O
warhead O
, O
and O
put O
it O

said O

`` O
But O
after O

After O

made O
about O
prohibited O

in O
Iraq B-LOC

which O
have O
not O
been O
found O
so O
far O
, O
skepticism O
about O
the O
quality O
of O
U.S B-LOC

is O
widespread O
. O

And O
in O
the O
case O
of O
North B-LOC
Korea I-LOC
, O
as O
in O
Iraq B-LOC
, O
the O
immediacy O
of O
the O
threat O
depends O
on O
whose O
analysis O
seems O
most O
compelling O
. O

So O
far O
, O
U.S B-LOC

intelligence O
has O
picked O
up O
almost O
no O
sign O
of O
the O

released O
into O
the O

when O

converted O

This O
has O
led O
some O
analysts O
to O
argue O
that O
the O
North O
Koreans O
may O
be O
farther O
from O
producing O
a O
weapon O
than O
feared O
a O
few O
months O
ago O

But O
others O
note O
that O
trucks O
were O
seen O
carrying O
the O
rods O
out O

their O
normal O
storage O
area O
months O

it O
is O
unclear O

Well O
um O
, O
I O
've O
been O
following O
it O
pretty O
closely O
. O

Um O
, O
I O
guess O
because O
of O
-- O
you O
know O
it O
being O
a O
mother O

-- O
being O
pregnant O
for O
a O

, O
So O
you O
-- O
how O

follow O
any O
of O
it O
at O
all O
when O
it O
was O
on O

or O
in O
the O

or O
anything O
? O

Irvin O
Hardly O
any O
of O
it O
at O
all O
, O
because O
-- O
um O
-- O
for O
one O
thing O
-- O
I O
do O
not O
have O
a O
~TV O

a O

I O
do O
n't O

Oh O

Irvin O
we O
get O
a O

. O

Winnette O
Okay O

Um O
, O
well O
I O
'll O
I O
do O
n't O
get O
any O

at O
the O
house O
, O
but O
-- O
I O
listen O
to O
the O
radio O
every O
morning O
on O
my O
way O
to O
work O
and O
Irvin O
Oh O
yeah O
? O

Winnette O
and O
uh O
-- O
when O
it O
first O
happened O
it O
was O
-- O
pretty O
publicized O
on O
every O
radio O
station O
um O
-- O
it O
come O
across O
-- O
on O
the O

and O
we O
keep O
our O
~TV O
on O
at O
my O
work O
, O
because O
we O
have O
a O

waiting O
area O
, O
so O
Irvin O
Oh O
, O
uh-huh O
. O

Winnette O
um O
actually O
one O
of O
our O
employees O
had O
wa- O
watched O
( O
( O
happening O
) O
) O
-- O
so O
from O
that O
point O
on O
we O
kind O
of O
-- O
talked O
a O
lot O
about O
it O
at O
work O
and O
Irvin O
How O
long O
ago O
was O
it O
? O

Winnette O
different O
things O
. O

Um O
, O
it O
was O
a O
year O
-- O
almost O
a O
year O
ago O
. O

Over O
a O
year O
ago O
? O

Because O
it O
was O
just O
before O
Christmas O
-- O
that O
it O
happened O
. O

Irvin O
Over O
a O
year O
ago O
. O

Winnette O
Yeah O
. O

Um O
, O
I O
'm O
thinking O
-- O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
November O
, O
December O
, O
I O
'm O
not O
sure O
exactly O
. O

But O
I O
know O
it O
was O
just O
before O
Christmas O
-- O
when O
they O
had O
uh O
-- O
it O
had O
happened O
, O
because O
she O
was O
missing O
during O
Christmas O
and O
then O
they O
had O
found O
her O
body O
. O

And O
they O
-- O
they O
found O
the O
baby O
as O
well O
. O

Irvin O
Terrible O
. O

Winnette O
Um O
, O
so O
when O
they O
found O
the O
baby O
, O
the O
baby O
of O
course O
had O
been O
-- O
they O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
the O
baby O
was O
born O
, O
through O
delivery O
, O
or O
-- O
if O
maybe O
from O
um O
-- O
the O
corpse O
I O
guess O
Irvin O
So O
the O
baby O
was O
separate O
. O

Winnette O
maybe O
extracted O
it O
. O

Um O
, O
actually O
she O
was O
pregnant O
for O
the O
baby O
. O

Irvin O
But O
the O
baby O
was O
separate O
from O
the O
body O
when O
he O
found O
it O
? O

Winnette O
Yes O
. O

Yep O
. O

Um O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
ma- O
I O
you O
know O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
the O
whole O
story O
for O
sure O
, O
but O
-- O
um O
-- O
he O
had O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
obviously O
-- O
denied O
that O
he O
was O
involved O
anything O
to O
do O
with O
it O
. O

Then O
they O
found O
out O
that O
he O
was O
having O
an O
affair O
on O
her O
. O

And O
-- O
then O
of O
course O
when O
they O
were O
investigating O
him O
-- O
he O
tried O
running O
. O

Dyed O
his O
hair O
and O
-- O
grew O
out O
a O
mustache O
and O
-- O
they O
caught O
him O
trying O
to O
run O
with O
-- O
quite O
a O
bit O
of O
cash O
. O

Irvin O
Wow O
. O

Winnette O
So O
I O
mean O
, O
Irvin O
( O
( O
) O
) O
Winnette O
he O
's O
-- O
in O
all O
honesty O
been O
guilty O
all O
along O
the O
way O
but O
Irvin O
Uh-huh O
. O

Winnette O
of O
course O
you O
know O
they O
've O
got O
to O
give O
him O
that O
reasonable O
doubt O
. O

Irvin O
Uh-huh O
. O

So O
is O
he O
is O
he O
still O
um O
-- O
in O
prison O
now O
? O

Winnette O
Yeah O
. O

And O
they O
're O
making O
the O
determination O
if O
-- O
in O
fact O
he O
will O
get O
the O
death O
penalty O
, O
or O
life O
in O
prison O
. O

So O
that O
's O
what O
's O
is O
up O
in O
the O
air O
right O
now O
. O

Irvin O
What O
state O
is O
this O
in O
? O

Winnette O
California B-LOC
. O

Irvin O
It O
's O
in O
California B-LOC
. O

Winnette O
And O
-- O
um O
-- O
I O
know O
I O
had O
, O
it O
was O
supposed O
to O
have O
be O
deliberated O
on O
-- O
the O
twenty-second O
of O
November O
, O
but O
they O
had O
an O
issue O
happen O
with O
-- O
one O
of O
the O
jurors O
-- O
so O
it O
's O
postponed O
everything O
. O

But O
, O
actually O
they O
were O
trying O
to O
pass O
a O
law O
, O
and O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
it O
ever O
did O
take O
into O
effect O
, O
that O
if O
in O
fact O
a O
mother O
was O
killed O
, O
and O
pregnant O
, O
um O
-- O
for O
there O
to O
be O
a O
double O
murder O
charge O
. O

Irvin O
Oh O
, O
uh-huh O
. O

Winnette O
And O
-- O
they O
were O
in O
fact O
trying O
to O
enforce O
the O
death O
penalty O
on O
that O
charge O
if O
they O
were O
-- O
found O
guilty O
on O
both O
charges O
. O

Irvin O
Uh-huh O
. O

Winnette O
And O
-- O
so O
it O
's O
kind O
of O
up O
in O
the O
air O
now O
-- O
because O
he O
-- O
I O
believe O
he O
got O
first O
degree O
murder O
and O
-- O
um O
and O
then O
got O
manslaughter O
on O
the O
baby O
. O

So O
he O
did O
n't O
get O
both O
first O
degree O
murders O
. O

Irvin O
What O
's O
the O
difference O
? O

Winnette O
Where O
-- O
Um O
, O
I O
guess O
because O
he O
did O
n't O
murder O
the O
baby O
directly O
. O

Irvin O
Oh O
. O

Winnette O
I O
'm O
thinking O
maybe O
was O
the O
difference O
. O

And O
because O
of O
the O
the O
charge O
on O
the O
baby O
, O
they O
could O
n't O
automatically O
give O
him O
the O
death O
penalty O
, O
but O
-- O
obviously O
there O
's O
enough O
-- O
um O
, O
complaints O
or O
whatever O
Irvin O
What O
was O
his O
excuse O
for O
doing O
something O
horrible O
like O
that O
? O

Winnette O
and O
-- O
well O
he O
still O
denies O
everything O
. O

He O
has O
never O
admitted O
Irvin O
( O
( O
Still O
does O
) O
) O
Winnette O
to O
do O
it O
. O

um O
-- O
But O
the O
only O
thing O
they O
can O
figure O
is O
that O
maybe O
-- O
he O
wanted O
back O
into O
the O
bachelor O
life O
, O
and O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
be O
a O
father O
, O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
be O
tied O
down O
with O
a O
wife O
and O
child O
Irvin O
So O
he O
did O
n't O
have O
any O
other O
children O
? O

Winnette O
that O
was O
-- O
No O
, O
that O
was O
going O
to O
be O
their O
first O
. O

And O
actually O
I O
don't O
even O
think O
they O
were O
married O
that O
long O
, O
maybe O
a O
year O
or O
two O

in O
large O

for O
the O
dysfunction O

characterizes O
our O
state O

now O
. O

Former O
Governor O
Gerald O
Baliles O
, O
in O
this O
same O
vein O
, O
has O
advocated O
a O
realignment O
of O
the O
two O
houses O
in O
a O
way O
that O
serves O
commonalities O
. O

He O
has O
suggested O
that O
we O
either O
increase O
membership O
in O
the O
Senate B-ORG
to O
50 O
, O
or O
decrease O
House B-ORG
membership O
to O
80 O
, O
producing O
a O
scenario O
wherein O
1 O
Senator O
would O
represent O
a O
block O
of O
people O
who O
are O
represented O
by O
exactly O
2 O
Delegates O
. O

He O
thinks O
-- O
and O
I O
think O
he O
is O
right O
-- O
that O
this O
arrangement O
would O
foster O
a O
closer O
working O
relationship O
between O
the O
Senate B-ORG
and O
the O
House B-ORG
. O

You O
certainly O
would O
n't O
have O
these O
dysfunctional O
groupings O
we O
now O
have O
, O
where O
1 O
Senator O
often O
represents O
a O
population O
divided O
among O
half O
a O
dozen O
Delegates O
of O
two O
parties O
-- O
three O

if O

The O

trying O
to O
curb O
the O

a O
devastating O
20-year-old O

that O
outlawed O

more O
than O
one O

As O
a O
result O
, O
only O
about O
100 O

are O
born O
for O
every O
119 O

or O
at O
the O
very O
least O
postpone O
, O
a O
war O
against O

, O
mainly O
because O
FDR O
was O
trying O
to O
provoke O
Hitler O
to O
war O
and O
did O
n't O
need O
a O
distraction O
on O
another O
distant O

work O
? O

( O

The O
thesis O
has O
been O
expounded O
by O
several O
conspiracy O
theorists O
, O
mainly O
the O
ones O
who O
expounded O
that O
FDR O
knew O
Pearl O
Harbor O
was O
about O
to O
be O
attacked O
, O
and O
let O
it O
happen O
. O

One O
of O
their O
`` O
proofs O
'' O
was O
that O
the O
US B-LOC
carriers O
were O
out O
of O
port O
during O
the O
attack O
, O
and O
`` O
everybody O
knew O
'' O
carriers O
were O
the O
capital O
ship O
of O
the O
future O
. O

However O
, O
the O
two O
carriers O
operating O
out O
of O
Pearl O
at O
the O
moment O
were O
sent O
West O
with O
light O
escort O
, O
on O
possibly O
intersecting O
routes O
with O
the O
IJN B-ORG
Kido O
Butai O
, O
which O
had O
far O
more O
carriers O
and O
a O
far O
heavier O
escort O
. O

Even O
stranger O
, O
the O
USS O
Enterprise O
was O
scheduled O
to O
be O
at O
Pearl O
by O
Dec O
6th O
, O
but O
got O
delayed O
by O
a O
storm O
. O

Consequently O
, O
for O
the O
PH O
conspiracy O
theorists O
to O
believe O
that O
FDR O
kept O
the O
carriers O
out O
of O
harm O
's O
way O
, O
we O
not O
only O
have O
to O
grant O
FDR O
the O
full O
knowledge O
of O
Kido O
Butai O
's O
route O
of O
approach O
would O
not O
result O
in O
either O
USN B-ORG
carrier O
fleet O
getting O
caught O
in O
a O
hopeless O
battle O
, O
but O
that O
FDR O
could O
psychically O
manipulate O
the O
weather O
to O
prevent O
Halsey O
from O
sailing O
into O
Pearl O
and O
thus O
be O
ambushed O
. O

To O
make O
a O
very O
long O
story O
short O
, O
it O
is O
foolish O
to O
assume O
that O
the O
US B-LOC
wanted O
to O
go O
to O
war O
against O
Japan B-LOC
prior O
to O
1941 O
, O
considering O
the O
weight O
of O
evidence O
arguing O
against O
a O
US B-LOC
desire O
for O
war O
, O
and O
the O
overwhelming O
lack O
of O

( O
not O

Re O

Here O
's O
something O
I O
wrote O
as O
part O
of O
a O
larger O
article O
, O
some O
while O
ago O
: O
Was O
n't O
Japan B-LOC
just O
defending O
herself O
when O
she O
attacked O
the O
US B-LOC
? O

This O
line O
of O
reasoning O
seems O
to O
derive O
from O
arguments O
that O
Japan B-LOC
was O
being O
'' O
driven O
into O
a O
corner O
'' O
by O
sanctions O
, O
and O
had O
no O
choice O
but O
to O
attack O
the O
US B-LOC
. O

Meiji B-LOC
Japan I-LOC
was O
driven O
to O
emulate O
what O
it O
thought O
the O
West B-LOC
was O
doing O
in O
every O
facet O
of O
society O
. O

They O
had O
observed O
, O
for O
example O
, O
that O
the O
West B-LOC
was O
able O
to O
carve O
up O
China B-LOC
into O
`` O
Spheres O
of O
Influence O
'' O
, O
and O
was O
able O
to O
do O
from O
great O
distances O
, O
while O
they O
, O
the O
Japanese B-LOC
, O
had O
had O
limited O
success O
in O
their O
previous O
attempts O
to O
dominate O
the O
Korean B-LOC
peninsula I-LOC
, O
much O
less O
China B-LOC
. O

As O
part O
of O
the O
catch-up O
effort O
, O
she O
whole-heartedly O
entered O
into O
the O
Imperialist O
game O
in O
Asia B-LOC
, O
being O
treated O
as O
an O
equal O
( O
relative O
to O
her O
power O
) O
by O
the O
other O
powers O
. O

However O
, O
after O
World O
War O
I O
, O
Japan B-LOC
failed O
to O
recognize O
a O
fundamental O
shift O
in O
the O
attitudes O
of O
her O
former O
Imperial O
partners O
; O
they O
began O
a O
long O
, O
slow O
process O
of O
disengaging O
themselves O
from O
their O
former O
Imperial O
areas O
, O
from O
their O
colonies O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
outright O
stopping O
all O
expansions O
. O

Japan B-LOC
chose O
to O
read O
this O
as O
a O
sign O
that O
the O
West B-LOC
had O
lost O
its O
power O
and O
resolve O
, O
and O
that O
Japan B-LOC
was O
the O
rightful O
heir O
to O
Imperial O
mantle O
in O
Asia B-LOC
. O

With O
the O
deaths O
of O
many O
of O
the O
idealistic O
leaders O
who O
had O
led O
Japan B-LOC
's O
rise O
to O
international O
prominence O
, O
and O
the O
refusal O
of O
the O
US B-LOC
to O
intervene O
in O
Asian B-LOC
affairs O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
Bolshevik O
revolution O
and O
the O
stripping O
of O
possessions O
from O
Germany B-LOC
, O
Britain B-LOC
found O
herself O
alone O
in O
dealing O
with O
an O
increasingly O
aggressive O
Japan B-LOC
in O
the O
area O
. O

Having O
a O
keen O
grasp O
of O
the O
obvious O
, O
she O
began O
a O
policy O
of O
acceding O
to O
Japanese B-LOC
hegemony O
in O
the O
area O
. O

Japan B-LOC
continued O
a O
policy O
of O
acquiring O
territory O
for O
some O
grand O
, O
illusive O
scheme O
of O
a O
`` O
Greater B-LOC
Asia I-LOC
'' O
, O
subordinate O
and O
grateful O
to O
Japan B-LOC
. O

The O
reality O
of O
this O
was O
that O
only O
a O
single O
possession O
, O
Manchuria B-LOC
, O
was O
profitable O
to O
the O
Japanese B-LOC
, O
and O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
Empire O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
a O
drain O
. O

This O
drain O
was O
greatly O
accelerated O
by O
Japan B-LOC
's O
invasion O
of O
China B-LOC
proper O
in O
1936 O
. O

It O
was O
a O
war O
that O
Japan B-LOC
assumed O
would O
be O
ended O
in O
`` O
3 O
to O
6 O
months O
'' O
; O
at O
the O
time O
of O
Pearl O

, O
it O
had O
been O
going O
on O
for O
5 O
years O
, O
at O
the O
cost O
of O
over O
half O
a O
million O
Japanese B-LOC
lives O
. O

The O
war O
put O
a O
tremendous O
strain O
on O
Japan B-LOC
( O
and O
was O
in O
fact O
opposed O
by O
more O
radically O
NATIONALISTIC O
elements O
, O
as O
taking O
away O
from O
the O
development O
of O
Japan B-LOC

other O

particularly O
in O
the O
areas O
of O
scrap O
metal O
and O

. O
) O

Domestic O
consumption O
fell O
, O
consumer O
goods O
became O
scarce O
, O
and O
the O
use O
of O
materiale O
for O
war O
purposes O
ate O
into O
Japan B-LOC
's O
domestic O
industry O
. O

This O
cut O
further O
into O
her O
foreign O
reserves O
, O
exacerbating O
the O
economic O
impact O
of O
the O
war O
. O

The O
war O
effort O
took O
on O
a O
life O
of O
its O
own O
, O
however O
, O
and O
common O
sense O
was O
subordinated O
to O
it O
. O

Japan B-LOC
expanded O
into O
areas O
of O
China B-LOC
and O
Indochina B-LOC
which O
had O
no O
strategic O
value O
to O
her O
, O
but O
put O
her O
in O
a O
position O
to O
threaten O
British B-LOC
and O
Dutch B-LOC
possessions O
in O
the O
area O
; O
possessions O
that O
both O
those O
Allied B-LOC
nations O
needed O
in O
order O
to O
continue O
their O
fight O
against O
Hitler O
. O

At O
this O
point O
, O
the O
US B-LOC
stopped O
ignoring O
the O
Japanese B-LOC
threat O
, O
and O
imposed O
a O
series O
of O
escalating O
sanctions O
on O
Japan B-LOC
, O
cutting O
off O
her O
scrap O
metal O
, O
limitting O
and O
then O
cutting O
off O
her O
oil O
( O
Japan B-LOC
imported O
most O
of O
both O
from O
the O
US B-LOC
. O
) O

While O
Japanese B-LOC
officials O
realized O
that O
they O
had O
enough O
of O
each O
resource O
for O
Japan B-LOC
to O
do O
well O
IF O
THE O
WAR O
IN O
CHINA B-LOC
STOPPED O
, O
they O
were O
powerless O
over O
the O
military O
they O
were O
supposed O
to O
control O
. O

An O
abortive O
attack O
on O
Soviet B-LOC
positions O
in O
Mongolia B-LOC
had O
placed O
Japan B-LOC
's O
focus O
firmly O
south O
, O
towards O
the O
possessions O
of O
the O
US B-LOC
' O
future O
allies O
. O

For O
no O
reason O
anyone O
could O
articulate O
, O
Japan B-LOC
felt O
she O
had O
to O
continue O
the O
war O
in O
China B-LOC
. O

To O
continue O
the O
war O
in O
China B-LOC
, O
she O
had O
to O
have O
resources O
of O
oil O
and O
metal O
. O

To O
have O
these O
resources O
, O
she O
must O
seize O
them O
, O
if O
others O
refused O
to O
sell O
them O

In O

she O
felt O
she O
had O
to O

Thus O
, O
for O

`` O

operation O
in O
China B-LOC
in O
1937 O

that O
the O

agreed O
upon O

so O

rhetoric O

-- O
that O

may O
have O
cost O

billions O

-- O
does O
n't O
match O
the O
reality O
that O
in O
a O
few O
cases O
, O
they O
manipulated O
bids O
, O
but O
that O
the O
proven O
damages O
thus O
far O
involve O
only O
a O

The O

The O
murder O

Most O

If O
you O

did O
nothing O

n't O
need O
that O
. O

What O
I O
really O
want O
to O
do O
is O
see O
somebody O
else O
enjoy O
it O
and O
the O
little O
kids O
enjoy O
it O
. O

So- O
-- O
and O
, O
uh O
, O
do O
a O
lot O
of O
parties O
with O
family O
-- O
and O
friends O
. O

Jane O
Well O
, O
that O
's O
kind O
of O
where- O
we O
're O
in O
between O
which O
family O
we O
're O
going O
to O
see O
and O
when O
and O
how O
and O
get O
all O
that O
worked O
out O
. O

Ed O
Uh O
, O
Jane O
Ed O
so O
whoev- O
yeah O
, O
I O
've O
seen O
them- O
-- O
just O
not O
the O
gifts O
it O
comes O
down O
to O
the O
food O
. O

See O
, O
now O
you O
( O
( O
) O
) O
. O

Jane O
There O
you O
go O
. O

I- O
one O
of O
these O
choices O
is O
meat O
cooking O
. O

We O
'll O
have O
to O
put O
that O
towards O
the O
end O
. O

Ed O
( O
( O
Ah O
, O
oui O
. O
) O
) O

-- O
Eh O
, O
( O
( O
nice O
) O
) O
. O

So O
we- O
we O
've O
only- O
Jane O
Ed O
my O
family O
's O
, O
uh O
, O
parents O
are O
deceased O
and O
most O
of O
( O
( O
them O
) O
) O
is O
, O
uh O
, O
passed O
my O
brothers O
all O
over O
, O
so O
her O
family O
's O
still O
younger O
-- O
and O
, O
uh O
, O
you O
know O
, O
just O
the O
odd O
sides O
. O

She O
's O
the O
oldest O
and O
I O
'm O
the O
youngest O
, O
so O
she O
's O
got O
younger O
which O
-- O
keeps O
the O
thing O
going O
, O
so O
I- O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
my O
view O
is O
-- O
( O
( O
stay O
) O
) O
with O
the O
family O
go O
visit O
the O
family O
. O

That O
's O
all O
you O
got O
. O

So O
-- O
keep O
it O
together O
through O
thick O
and O
thin O
and O
-- O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
Thanksgiving O
we O
go O
up O
there O
and O
we O
celebrate O
. O

And O
then O
there's O
little O
parties O
. O

Big- O
uh O
, O
her O
sister O
does O
a O
big O
family O
party O
-- O
but O
try O
to O
keep O
that O
same O
Jane O
Ed O
local O
family O
coming O
together O
. O

It O
's O
amazing O
how O
they O
can O
get O
into O
little O
squabbles O
and O
who O
does O
n't O
show O
up O
Jane O
Of O
course O
. O

Ed O
like O
that O
. O

I O
think O
it O
's O
crazy O
. O

So O
, O
( O
( O
so O
, O
uh O
) O
) O
- O
Jane O
They O
used O
to O
always O
really O
all O
get O
together O
. O

but O
his O
parents O
uh O
they O
actually O
live O
next O
door O
to O
us O
. O

but O
they O
're O
starting O
to O
get O
up O
in O
the O
years O
, O
so O
they O
're O
not O
, O
you O
know O
, O
hosting O
the O
big O
parties O
, O
so O
it's O
funny O
how O
now O
people O
do O
n't O
all O
bother O
to O
come O
Ed O
Yeah O
. O

Jane O
and O
you O
kind O
of O
wonder O
you O
know O
in O
the O
next O
couple O
of O
years O
what O
's O
all O
going O
to O
happen O
. O

Are O
they O
all O
going O
to O
see O
each O
other O
. O

Ed O
Yeah O
, O
no O
that's- O
that O
's O
exactly O
. O

I O
've O
already O
seen O
, O
you O
know O
, O
( O
( O
in O
) O
) O
my O
parents O
( O
( O
' O
bed O
) O
) O
until O
they O
( O
( O
got O
) O
) O
less O
and O
less O
that O
the O
brothers O
got O
together O
-- O
and O
then O
now O
when O
there O
's O
an O
event O
you O
try O
to O
do O
it O
. O

At O
Christmas O
it O
's O
just O
impossible O
because O
we O
leave O
-- O
two O
days O
after O
Christmas O
Jane O
Mhm O
. O

Ed O
to O
go O
out O
of O
the O
country O
as O
part O
of O
our O
New O
Year's O
Jane O
Ed O
celebration O
. O

So O
, O
for O
us O
it O
's O
, O
you O
know O
, O
got O
to O
be O
a O
quick O
trip O
up O
Jane O
Ed O
to O
her O
family O
and O
then O
back O
where O
we- O
-- O
we O
've O
been O
invited O
to O
be O
down O
in O
Jane O
Ed O
another O
country O
. O

If O
a O
person O
is O
not- O
even O
though O
it O
's O
cold O
up O
in O
the O
Northeast O
, O
it O
's O
a O
family O
tradition O
. O

I O
should O
do O
it O
-- O
and O
less O
for O
the O
gifts O
and O
more O
for O
Jane O
Ed O
being O
together O
. O

Yeah O
. O

Jane O
Well O
, O
we O
did- O
-- O
-for O
the O
kids O
you O
know O
we O
made O
it O
pretty O
cl- O
Ed O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
I O
think O
that O
's O
great O
. O

Jane O
-you O
know O
, O
you O
did O
n't O
have O
all O
the O
hassle O
of O
running O
around O
and O
being O
crazy O
and O
just O
kind O
of O
spent O
time O
together O
Ed O
And O
I O
think O
that O
's O
very- O
I O
mean O
, O
if- O
Jane O
and O
it O
was O
really O
pretty O
nice O
. O

Ed O
Yeah O
, O
we O
haven't- O
-- O
yeah O
, O
I O
think O
-- O
e- O
e- O
eventually O
that O
may O
happen O
, O
the O
way O
we O
're O
going O
with O
, O
uh O
, O
Jane O
Ed O
my O
wife O
and O
I O
with O
her O
Jane O
Ed O
family O
. O

Not O
as O
a O
negative O
but O
as O
a- O
Jane O
Ed O
you O
know O
, O
we O
do O
a O
lot O
of O
traveling O
so O
that O
's O
going O
to O
be- O
I O
think O
that O
's O
going O
to O
come O
up O
. O

Jane O
Ed O
But- O
-- O
but O
for O
now O
we O
're O
still O
trying O
to O
do- O
Jane O
Ed O
as O
long O
as O
the O
mother O
's O
around O
, O
we O
'll O
still O
do O
Christmas O
and O
act O
as- O
Jane O
Ed O
she O
is O
not O
really O
old O
, O
but O
she O
's O
getting O
older O
, O
so O
I O
think O
that O
's O
one O
reason O
to O
stay O
together O
Jane O
Ed O
and O
also O
I O
think O
i- O
is O
Jane O
Ed O
eh O
, O
we- O
we O
kind O
of O
-- O
infused O
a O
little O
family O
party O
that O
her O
sister O
has O
so O
-- O
I O
think O
if O
we O
were O
to O
go O
away O
both O
of O
those O
might O
fall O
off O
a O
little O
bit O
and O
it O
does O
n't O
take O
but O
one O
year O
and O
then O
all O
of O
the O
sudden O
everybody's O
Jane O
Yeah O
. O

Ed O
not O
coming O
to O
it O
anymore O
and O
it O
's O
like O
a- O
Jane O
That O
's O
it O
. O

That O
's O
the O
way O
it O
is O
. O

Ed O
Yeah O
, O
but O
not O
because- O
Jane O
If O
I O
'm O
no- O
Ed O
it O
is- O
-- O
I- O
I O
enjoy O
the O
-- O
smiling O
people O
and O
the O
festive- O
-- O
festive O
nature O
and O
-- O
I O
think O
it O
does O
get O
a O
little O
commercialized O
. O

( O
( O
It O
's O
not O
that O
the- O
) O
) O
-- O
You O
can O
ignore O
that O
part O
of O
it O

I O

Ted O

Obo O
I O
did O

I O
I O
do O

for O
the O

Ted O
Uh-huh O
. O

Obo O
ever O
, O
I O
usually O
try O
to O
stay O
out O
of O
the O
main O
party O
, O
because O
I O
think O
, O
and O
this O
last O
election O
showed O
that O
both O
are O
very O
brutal O
. O

Ted O
It O
was O
Obo O
Um O
, O
yeah O
I O
think O
that O
the O
, O
uh O
Ted O
election O
. O

Obo O
Oh O
, O
I O
'm O
sorry O
. O

Ted O
It O
was O

, O
yeah O
, O
it O

, O
yeah O
, O
you O
're O
absolutely O
, O

, O
and O
I O
'm O

, O
I O
mean O
, O
if O
you O
want O
to O
add O
anything O
I O
'm O

. O

Ted O
No O
no O
, O
go O
ahead O
, O
go O
ahead O
. O

Obo O
And O
, O
ah O
-- O
It O
's O
, O
it O
's O
just O
that O
-- O
Like O
, O
I O
I O
just O
, O
I O
think O
that O
the O
last O
fifty O
years O
, O
the O
government O
has O
been O
mes- O
messed O
up O
by O
both O
these O
parties O
, O
honestly O
. O

Even O
maybe O
before O
that O
. O

So O
, O
I O
, O
I O
usually O
do O
third O
party O

um O
, O
and O
the O
way O
it O
was O
working O
this O
year O
was O
that O
the O
Democrats O
really O
pushed O
to O
get O
Ralph O
Nader O
off O
the O
ballot O
Ted O
Yeah O
. O

Yeah O
they O
did O
. O

Obo O
in O
every O
state O
, O
and O
um O
-- O
I O
mean O
, O
the O
Republicans O
sort O
of O
tried O
to O
play O
like O
they O
were O
helping O
him O
out O
, O
but O
they O
knew O
they O
they O
did O
n't O
really O
have O
to O
because O
they O
knew O
the O
Democrats O
were O
already O
doing O
more O
damage O
to O
keep O
him O
off O
the O
ballot O
and O
they O
were O
successful O
, O
and O
for O
a O
progressive O
party O
that O
was O
very O
brutal O
. O

Ted O
Mhm O
, O
it O
was O
. O

Obo O
And O
I O
was O
n't O
really O
impressed O
by O
either O
of O
the O
two O
vice O
presidential O
candidates O
, O
I O
know O
Dick O
Cheney O
seems O
to O
be O
running O
the O
show O
Ted O
You O
know O
? O

Obo O
and O
, O
ah O
-- O
I O
mean O
, O
and O
, O
and O
a O
lot O
of O
it O
has O
to O
do O
-- O
and O
then O
, O
I O
just O
did O
n't O
know O
much O
, O
John O
Edwards O
seemed O
nice O
, O
but O
he O
just O
, O
you O
know O
, O
he O
was O
just O
, O
he O
just O
got O
elected O
to O
the O
Senate B-ORG
, O
and O
, O
I O
was O
n't O
really O
familiar O
too O
much O
with O
hi- O
I O
mean O
, O
I O
think O
it O
's O
great O
that O
he O
got O
into O
the O
vice O
presidential O
role O
, O
but O
-- O
again O
, O
it O
's O
the O
whole O
parties O
that O
I O
'm O
really O
not O
really O
I O
do O
n't O
like O
their O
policies O
. O

Ted O
Well O
, O
you O
kind O
of O
hit O
on O
some O
of O
my O
sentiments O
, O
um O
, O
I O
'm O
a O
fifty-year- O
old O
black O
male O
, O
and O
this O
was O
my O
first O
election O
that O
I O
participated O
in O
. O

And O
the O
reason O
was O
was O
that O
, O
ah O
, O
I O
'm O
retired O
Air B-ORG
Force I-ORG
-- O
and O
before O
, O
ah O
, O
because O
I O
was O
in O
the O
military O
-- O
ah O
, O
did O
n't O
did O
n't O
really O
think O
that O
my O
vote O
, O
um O
, O
counted O
one O
way O
or O
the O
other O
, O
that O
's O
that O
was O
my O
thinking O
. O

You O
know O
, O
I O
had O
a O
role O
to O
fulfill O
and O
regardless O
of O
how O
I O
voted O
, O
uh O
, O
I O
was O
going O
to O
have O
to O
fulfill O
that O
role O
. O

Um O
, O
Obo O
Yeah O
. O

Ted O
the O
, O
the O
situation O
, O
though O
, O
now O
that O
I O
'm O
out O
and O
, O
in O
the O
civilian O
sector O
, O
um O
, O
I O
find O
that O
the O
economics O
as O
far O
as O
home O
-- O
is O
what O
I'm O
most O
concerned O
with O
. O

And O
because O
of O
the O
economic O
situation O
, O
I O
don't O
think O
that O
's O
being O
addressed O
. O

Yes O
, O
I O
feel O
very O
, O
very O
bad O
in O
regards O
to O
the O
, O
ah O
, O
nine-eleven O
tragedy O
and O
terrorism O
and O
this O
kind O
of O
stuff O
Obo O
Mhm O
. O

Ted O
um O
, O
but O
I O
think O
so O
much O
attention O
is O
being O
paid O
to O
that O
-- O
that O
-- O
as O
you O
mentioned O
, O
over O
the O
past O
fifty O
years O
, O
the O
two O
parties O
that O
run O
the O
country O
-- O
um O
, O
have O
definitely O
taken O
a O
, O
um O
-- O
streamlined O
approach O
to O
whatever O
their O
agenda O
may O
be O
and O
not O
the O
will O
of O
the O
people O
. O

Obo O
You O
said O
it O
very O
well O
. O

I O
totally O
, O
you O
coul- O
I O
could O
n't O
have O
said O
it O
better O
. O

Ted O
Now O
it O
's O
uh O
-- O
and O
as O
time O
goes O
on O
, O
you O
know O
, O
like O
, O
ah O
, O
what O
are O
we O
, O
you O
know O
, O
headed O
for O
, O
what O
are O
we O
faced O
with O
? O

Obo O
I O
I O
Ted O
I O
mean O
, O
if O
we O
do O
n't O
start O
looking O
inward O
and O
start O
taking O
care O
of O
things O
at O
home O
-- O
uh O
, O
right O
now O
, O
yeah O
, O
we O
are O
the O
biggest O
power O
in O
the O
world O
. O

I O
heard O
a O
commentary O
by O
Rush O
Limbaugh O
, O
ah O
, O
the O
other O
day O
, O
and O
the O
comment O
was O
made O
was O
that O
there O
always O
is O
going O
to O
be O
a O
big O
dog O
on O
the O
street O
. O

And O
right O
now O
I O
'm O
proud O
to O
be O
, O
ah O
, O
you O
know O
, O
behind O
the O
big O
dog O
, O
meaning O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
. O

If O
i- O
if O
if O
-- O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
is O
not O
the O
big O
dog O
, O
some O
power O
in O
the O
world O
is O
going O
to O
step O
up O
and O
be O
just O
that O
. O

We O
got O
so O
many O
crises O
and O
tension O
uh O
what O
do O
you O

Glad O
to O
meet O
you O
. O

Well O
, O
the O
topic O
is O
interesting O
, O
but O
they O
've O
been O
having O
this O
one O
for O
three O
days O
. O

I O
don't O
know O
why O
they O
're O
so O
obsessed O
with O
it O
. O

Mohammed O
Seems O
like O
it O
's O
a O
weekend O
, O
or O
they O
want O
to O
get O
as O
much O
as O
they O
can O
feedback O
from O
people O
. O

Jean O
I O
guess O
so O
, O
Yes O
. O

Mohammed O
And O
so O
what O
do O
you O
think O
was- O
Jean O
I O
I O
did O
n't O
actually O
-- O
watch O
the O
trial O
very O
much O
, O
uh O
th- O
in O
fact O
, O
I O
did O
n't O
watch O
the O
trial O
at O
all O
. O

Mohammed O
Mhm O
. O

Jean O
I O
read O
about O
it O
in O
the O
newspaper O
and O
things O
like O
that O
. O

Um O
, O
I O
do O
think O
from O
all O
the O
, O
uh O
, O
things O
that O
I O
have O
heard O
that O
he O
-- O
had O
to O
be O
guilty O
with O
all O
the O
evidence O
that O
they O
had O
, O
but O
um O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
really O
know O
why O
, O
uh O
, O
if O
everybody O
was O
so O
, O
sort O
of O
, O
obsessed O
about O
it O
when O
we O
've O
got O
so O
much O
other O
-- O
things O
going O
on O
in O
the O
world O
that O
, O
uh O
, O
seem O
to O
me O
much O
more O
important O
, O
but O
um O
. O

Perhaps O
it O
was O
because O
he O
seemed O
, O
uh O
, O
a O
very O
human O
kind O
of O
person O
and O
, O
and O
you O
cou- O
you O
could O
n't O
really O
understand O
why O
he O
would O
want O
to O
do O
something O
about O
that O
. O

I- O
I O
think O
his O
motive O
must O
have O
been O
to O
be O
with O
his O
new O
girlfriend O
, O
but O
uh- O
-- O
kill O
his O
own O
first O
child O
that O
way O
is O
extraordinary O
. O

What O
do O
you O
think O
? O

Mohamed O
? O

Mohammed O
Yeah O
. O

Jean O
And O
what O
do O
you- O
What O
do O
you O
think O
about O
it O
? O

Mohammed O
Being O
very O
frankly O
, O
I O
was O
not O
, O
uh O
, O
following O
the O
case O
at O
all O
even O
uh O
uh O
television O
, O
or O
uh O
reading O
, O
but O
from O
what O
I O
can O
observe O
, O
that O
it O
seems O
, O
eh O
, O
it O
has O
been O
talking O
-- O
-- O
taking O
too O
long O
time O
. O

Like O
one O
year O
almost O
, O
now O
. O

It O
was- O
Jean O
When O
you O
what O
? O

Mohammed O
It O
was O
-- O
taking O
so O
much O
time O
. O

Long O
time O
. O

Jean O
Yes O
. O

Mohammed O
The O
case O
is O
almost O
one O
year O
. O

Like O
last O
, O
uh O
, O
Christmas O
if O
I O
'm O
not O
, O
uh O
, O
recalling O
my O
memory O
. O

So O
for O
one O
year O
, O
it O
's O
really O
a O
good O
time O
. O

Hu- O
So O
I O
'm O
asking O
myself O
why O
it O
took O
such O
a O
long O
Jean O
Hm O
. O

Mohammed O
It O
may O
be O
because O
-- O
it O
's O
quite O
important O
, O
or O
so O
there O
is O
so O
many O
everything O
's O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
it O
's O
, O
it O
's O
a O
really O
different O
case O
. O

But O
, O
the O
quo- O
the O
nice O
quotient O
is O
about O
the O
media O
. O

But O
the O
media O
have O
biased O
in O
this O
, O
Jean O
Yes O
. O

Mohammed O
or O
not O
? O

I O
believe O
that O
media O
is O
a O
very O
good O
, O
uh O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
uh O
, O
way O
to O
give O
us O
all O
the O
opportunity O
to O
understand O
and O
see O
. O

I O
mean O
without O
the O
media O
, O
you O
and O
I O
, O
how O
we O
will O
be O
knowing O
? O

Jean O
No O
, O
exactly O
. O

Do O
you O
think O
they O
were O
biased O
in O
in O
-- O
favor O
of O
him O
, O
or O
in O
favor O
Mohammed O
I- O
-- O
No O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
so O
. O

Jean O
No O
, O
I O
did O
n't O
think O
so O
either O
from O
what O
I O
heard O
. O

Mohammed O
Maybe O
-- O
sometimes O
in- O
in- O
in- O
in O
other O
issues O
they- O
they O
may O
be O
biased O
, O
but O
in O
this O
issue O
they O
were O
just O
-- O
covering O
what O
's O
happening O
, O
Jean O
Yes O
. O

Mohammed O
and O
, O
uh O
, O
they O
give O
us O
the O
picture O
. O

It O
was O
a O
camera O
-- O
to O
give O
you O
the O
view O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
they O
were O
biased O
in O
this O
case O
here O
. O

Jean O
Yes O
. O

No O
. O

Mohammed O
And O
, O
uh O
, O
what O
do O
you O
think O
will O
happen O
next O
? O

Jean O
Well O
, O
uh O
they O
're O
coming O
up O
to O
the O
sentencing O
, O
and O
I O
heard O
yesterday O
or O
read O
in O
the O
newspaper O
or O
something O
that O
his O
brother O
-- O
I O
guess O
it O
was O
on O
the O
television O
. O

In O
the O
news O
, O
his O
brother O
was O
appealing O
-- O
for O
them O
to O
to O
sentence O
him O
to O
-- O
to O
prison O
for O
life O
rather O
than O
the O
death O
penalty O
, O
because O
-- O
he O
said O
he O
's O
a O
very O
good O
listener O
and O
he O
cares O
about O
people O
, O
and O
and O
he O
might O
be O
able O
to O
help O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
in O
prison O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
whether O
that O
is O
true O
or O
not O
. O

I O
know O
that O
he O
had O
done O
a O
lot O
of O
volunteer O
things O
before O
, O
and O
that O
was O
the O
one O
things O
that O
made O
me O
wonder O
there O
was O
any O
possible O
chance O
that O
it O
could O
have O
been O
somebody O
else O
who O
did O
it O
. O

I O
think O
given O
such O
as O
I O
have O
heard O
, O
even O
though O
like O
you O
, O
I O
did O
not O
follow O
the O
case O
day O
by O
day O
or O
anything O
like O
that O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
quite O
see O
how O
he O
could O
not O
be O
guilty O
if O
they O
've O
got O
so O
much O
that O
appears O
to O
point O
to O
him O
. O

And O
what O
would O
be O
the O
motive O
for O
anybody O
trying O
to O
-- O
to O

You O
do O
well O
to O
wonder O
why O
the O
BTK O
killer O
was O
not O
captured O
until O
yesterday O
. O

The O
informal O
speculation O
is O
that O
the O
Wichita B-LOC
police O
department O
was O
not O
up O
to O
the O
task O
. O

Consider O
this O
: O
-One O
of O
the O
BTK O
killer O
's O
victims O
lived O
on O
the O
same O
street O
as O
the O
killer O
-The O
BTK O
killer O
once O
called O
up O
a O
police O
dispatcher O
and O
told O
her O
of O
the O
crime O
he O
just O
committed O
, O
and O
still O
they O
could O
not O
catch O
him O
-the O
BTK O
killer O
was O
a O
known O
nitpicker O
and O
nuissance O
. O

This O
is O
actually O
a O
indicator O
in O
profiles O
of O
serial O
killers O
and O
mastermind O
terrorists O
. O

-the O
BTK O
killer O
was O
only O
found O
out O
when O
his O
daughter O
recognized O
certain O
traits O
and O
turned O
in O
her O
DNA O
, O
which O
was O
a O
close O
match O
to O
the O
DNA O
on O
file O
for O
her O
father O
. O

Like O
in O
the O
case O
of O
the O
Unibomber O
, O
if O
it O
wasn't O
for O
the O
foresight O
and O
charity O
of O
a O
relative O
, O
the O
BTK O
killer O
would O
still O
be O
loose O
. O

I O
was O
once O
reading O
how O
a O
criminal O
was O
being O
tracked O
in O
Washington B-LOC
, O
DC B-LOC
, O
and O
how O
he O
escaped O
a O
police O
dragnet O
several O
times O
, O
once O
by O
taking O
a O
taxi O
. O

Though O
there O
are O
very O
brave O
police O
, O
to O
a O
large O
extent O
the O
police O
have O
no O
incentive O
to O
capture O
a O
criminal O
, O
just O
to O
stay O
out O
of O
harm O
's O
way O
and O
to O
collect O
facts O
after O
the O
fact O
. O

The O

one O
for O
a O

defense O
attorneys O
argue O
that O
there O

much O

an O
alleged O
confession O
from O

, O
that O
this O
has O
tainted O

their O
more O
intriguing O

that O

of O

this O

there O

a O
motion O

attorneys O
argue O
that O
an O
individual O

The O
one O

in O
which O
Europe B-LOC
incontrovertibly O
beats O
the O
US B-LOC
is O
their O
aviation O
industry O

thanks O
mainly O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
their O

have O
left O
the O

the O

up O
to O
the O
people O
who O
own O
it O
, O
and O
left O
passenger O

in O
the O

of O

And O
now O
they O
're O
ready O
to O

that O
with O

did O
n't O
see O
us O

as O

when O
the O

The O

One O

soldier O
and O
his O
only O
chance O
for O
survival O
was O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
these O
two O
Iraqis O
. O

Recalling O
the O
medical O
classes O
they O
'd O
received O
from O
the O
special O
forces O
, O
the O
Iraqis O
reacted O
calmly O
, O
fastening O
a O
belt O
above O
the O
wound O
, O
creating O
a O
tourniquet O
, O
which O
stopped O
the O
gushing O
stream O
of O
red O
. O

They O
moved O
the O
soldier O
to O
a O
MEDVAC O
vehicle O
via O
two-man O
litter O
carry O
. O

After O
they O
hoisted O
the O
soldier O
in O
the O
truck O
, O
the O
two O
Iraqis O
-- O
one O
an O
officer O
, O
the O
other O
an O
NCO O
-- O
ran O
back O
to O
the O
facility O
and O
began O
treating O
the O
other O
wounded O
without O
regard O
for O
their O
safety O
. O

When O
the O
dust O
settled O
and O
the O
mess O
tent O
had O
been O
evacuated O
, O
everybody O
who O
could O
talk O
was O
questioned O
about O
their O
health O
. O

When O
the O
medics O
came O
to O
the O
two O
Iraqis O
, O
the O
ING B-ORG
soldiers O
only O
wanted O
to O
know O
how O
everybody O
else O
was O
. O

When O
asked O
why O
did O
they O
do O
it O
, O
they O
simply O
stated O
, O
`` O
this O
was O
our O
duty O

we O
are O
a O

take O

This O
brings O
to O
mind O
a O
speech O
Prime O
Minister O
Tony O
Blair O
gave O
recently O
while O
visiting O
Iraq B-LOC

When O
I O
meet O
the O
people O
working O
alongside O
the O
United B-ORG

-- O
Iraqis O
in O
fear O
of O
their O

every O

, O
because O
they O
are O
trying O
to O
bring O
freedom O
and O
democracy O
to O
their O
people O
-- O
when O
I O
see O
their O
courage O
and O
their O
determination O
and O
know O
that O
they O
speak O
for O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
people O
in O
Iraq B-LOC
who O
want O
that O
democracy O
and O
freedom O
, O
then O
I O
know O
that O
we O
are O
doing O
the O
right O
thing O
. O

. O

. O

. O

And O
I O
will O
also O
say O
this O
to O
you O
: O
There O
are O
people O
dying O
in O
Iraq B-LOC
, O
but O
the O
reason O
people O
are O
dying O
is O
because O
of O
the O
terrorism O
and O
the O
intimidation O
and O
the O
people O
who O
are O
deliberately O
killing O
anyone O
trying O
to O
make O
this O

better O
. O

Now O
what O
should O
our O
response O
be O
as O
an O
international O
community O
? O

Our O
response O
should O
be O
to O
stand O

the O

who've O

Sometimes O
when O

of O
what O

the O
rest O

I O
just O
feel O
that O

should O
understand O
how O
precious O
what O
has O
been O
created O
here O
is O
. O

And O
those O
people O
from O
that O

that O
I O
described O

the O
heroes O
of O
the O

every O

a O

or O

even O

and O
yet O
they O
carry O
on O

Now O
what O
a O

( O

) O
, O
whose O
aging O
CEO O
has O
no O
plans O
to O
retire O
. O

Maurice O
R. O
`` O
Hank O
'' O
Greenberg O
, O
who O
turns O
80 O
in O
May O
, O
groomed O
two O
sons O
to O
be O
successors O
, O
but O
both O
have O
since O
left O
AIG.Greenberg B-ORG
Sr. O
then O
created O
an O
office O
of O
the O
chairman O
in O
2002 O
, O
which O
includes O
co-COOs O
Martin O
J. O
Sullivan O
and O
Donald O
P. O
Kanak O
. O

Both O
are O
considered O
possible O
successors O
, O
but O
the O
board O
wo O
n't O
know O
Greenberg's O
preference O
until O
his O
departure O
, O
when O
it O
opens O
a O
sealed O
letter O
. O

Perhaps O
this O
is O
a O
good O
time O
for O
a O
quick O
refresher O
... O
. O

The O
CEO O
works O
for O
the O
board O
... O
end O
lesson O
. O

I O
guess O
it O
is O
not O
as O
straight O
forward O
when O
your O
CEO O
is O
also O
chairman O
and O
one O
of O
the O
largest O
shareholders O
. O

It O
would O
be O
tempting O
to O
get O
on O
my O
high O
horse O
right O
now O
about O
the O
need O
to O
separate O
the O
positions O
of O
CEO O
and O
Chairman O
but O
to O
be O
honest O
with O
you O
I O
do O
n't O
really O
believe O
that O
. O

I O
know O
CEO/chair O
duality O
is O
a O
popular O
cause O
for O
corporate O
governance O
. O

However O
there O
is O
little O
empirical O
evidence O
to O
suggest O
that O
separating O
these O
roles O
affects O
firm O
performance O
in O
either O
a O
positive O
or O
negative O
way O
. O

Having O
a O
combined O
CEO/Chairman O
does O
reduce O
the O
ability O
of O
the O
board O
to O
act O
as O
a O
check O
on O
management O
and O
this O
does O
mean O
that O
you O
need O
to O
be O
more O
critical O
in O
your O
assessment O
of O
the O
trustworthiness O
of O
the O
top O
management O
team O
. O

This O
downside O
of O
having O
a O
combined O
CEO/chair O
is O
offset O
by O
( O
1 O
) O
a O
reduction O
of O
coordination O
and O
communication O
costs O
at O
the O
top O
of O
the O
organization O
and O
( O
2 O
) O
an O
increase O
in O
the O
negotiating O
position O
of O
the O
CEO O
when O
dealing O
with O
suppliers O
, O
potential O
merger O
partners O
, O
etc O
. O

# O
2 O
could O
be O
particularly O
useful O
in O
a O
dynamic O
industry O
. O

I O
do O
however O
look O
more O
carefully O
at O
the O
top O
management O
team O
of O
a O
company O
with O
a O
CEO/Chair O
before O
investing O
. O

It O
is O
important O
that O
you O
can O
get O
a O
sense O
of O
the O
trustworthiness O
of O
the O
CEO O
. O

Is O
there O
high O
turnover O
among O
senior O
managers O
? O

Is O
there O
a O
record O
of O
regulatory O
problems O
? O

If O
the O
CEO O
is O
new O
, O
I O
also O
look O
at O
the O
performance O
of O
the O
CEO O
's O
previous O
company O
. O

I O
am O
most O
concerned O
if O
the O
fortunes O
of O
the O
prior O
employer O
took O
a O
sudden O
turn O
for O
the O
worse O

that O

simply O

that O
if O

the O

if O

She O

She O

they O

Waitaminit O
, O
you O
said O
she O
DOES O

OK O
, O
he/she O
is O
doing O
all O
they O
can O
, O
but O
that O
's O
not O
much O
, O
under O
the O
circumstances O
. O

You O
're O
complaining O
that O
YOU O
ca O
n't O
get O
an O

? O

You O
do O
n't O
need O
one O
. O

And O
her O
attys O
will O
not O
talk O
to O
you O
because O
you O

not O

participate O
in O
their O

But O
wo O
n't O
your O
GF O
tell O
you O
these O
things O
? O

If O
not O
, O
maybe O
it O
's O
because O
she O
does O
n't O
want O
you O
to O
know O
either O
. O

Which O
you O
would O

It O

just O
one O

I O
have O
n't O
been O
back O
since O
1994 O
and O
when O
I O
was O
talking O
to O
my O
wife O
about O
the O
trip O
this O
morning O
, O
it O
seems O
like O
a O
lifetime O
ago O
. O

Hell O
, O
it's O
been O
half O
my O
life O
since O
I O
was O
in O
school O
there O
and O
over O
two O
thirds O
of O
my O
adult O
life O
, O
assuming O
that O
people O
that O
know O
me O
think O
my O
adult O
life O
has O
actually O
started O
yet O
. O

Anyway O
, O
enough O
nostalgia O
from O
me O
, O
at O
least O
for O
now O
. O

The O
wife O
and O
I O
were O
watching O

Lee O

, O
I O
open O
the O
Atlanta B-LOC

this O

and O
EVERYTHING O
is O
pro-UGA B-ORG
. O

I O
mean O
, O
I O
knew O
it O
would O
be O
, O
but O
some O
of O
it O
was O
even O
based O
on O
facts O
. O

Like O
this O
beauty O
: O
When O
Auburn B-ORG
and O
their O
opponent O
are O
both O
in O
the O
top O
ten O
, O
Auburn B-ORG
is O
4-6-1 O
in O
those O
games O
. O

Auburn B-ORG
has O
lost O
the O
last O
three O
games O
that O
fit O
that O
scenario O
. O

Blurble O

Auburn B-ORG

last O

came O
at O
the O
hands O
of O

UGA B-ORG

Blurble O
... O
Auburn B-ORG
does O
lead O
the O
overall O
record O
in O

51-46-8 O

, O
the O

in O
this O

AT O

UGA B-ORG

At O

This O

was O
serious O
in O
the O
80 O

, O
with O
the O
road O
team O
winning O
about O
two-thirds O
of O
the O

. O

The O
only O
time O
this O
changed O
recently O
really O
was O
when O
UGA B-ORG

On O

upside O

Auburn B-ORG
has O
scored O
at O

33 O
points O
in O
the O
last O
six O
games O
. O

That O
's O
a O
pretty O
nice O
run O
. O

Auburn B-ORG
leads O
the O
SEC B-ORG
in O
scoring O
offense O
, O
scoring O
defense O
and O
rushing O
defense O
. O

Auburn B-ORG
is O
second O
in O
the O
nation O
in O
scoring O
defense O
and O
seventh O
in O

defense O
. O

Jason O

David O

Here O
are O
a O
couple O
of O

stats O
: O
Auburn B-ORG

Quentin O
Groves O
and O
Georgia B-ORG
's O
David O
Pollack O
are O
tied O
for O
the O
SEC B-ORG
sack O
lead O
. O

Here O
's O
the O
biggest O
for O
what O
it O
's O
worth O
stat O
as O
far O
as O
I O
am O
concerned O
: O
both O
teams O
are O
undefeated O
this O
year O
when O
scoring O
first O
. O

Auburn B-ORG
is O
8-0 O
and O
UGA B-ORG
is O
5-0 O
. O

I O
'd O
say O
that O
's O
the O
biggest O
stat O
right O
now O
. O

Auburn B-ORG
's O
offense O
is O
potent O
and O
efficient O
. O

UGA B-ORG
's O
defense O
is O
relentless O
and O
contains O
a O
couple O
of O
the O
country O
's O
biggest O
hitters O
, O
especially O
Greg O
Blue O
and O
Odell O
Thurman O
. O

Auburn B-ORG
's O
defense O
is O
fast O
and O
relentless O
and O
the O
DB O
's O
are O
experienced O
and O
big O
. O

UGA B-ORG
's O
receivers O
are O
leaders O
, O
with O
one O
of O
them O
a O
team O
captain O
. O

Auburn B-ORG
's O
two O
running O
backs O
are O
seniors O
and O
very O
experienced O
and O
dangerous O
, O
bruising O
backs O
. O

UGA B-ORG
's O
two O
backs O
are O
smaller O
freshmen O
with O
less O
experience O
, O
but O
are O
dangerous O
as O
well O
. O

In O
my O
mind O
, O
the O
game O
is O
going O
to O
turn O
on O
a O
few O
key O
points O
, O
some O
obvious O
and O
some O
not O
. O

Here O
goes O
the O
prediction O
machine O
: O
- O
Turnovers O
( O
as O
always O
) O
will O
be O
critical O
. O

- O
Special O
teams O
play O
and O
lack O
of O
special O
teams O
mistakes O
will O
tell O
the O
tale O
regarding O
field O
position O
. O

- O
Both O
teams O
MUST O
establish O
the O
run O
to O
be O
successful O
. O

If O
Auburn B-ORG
goes O
for O
150 O
between O
their O
two O
backs O
, O
they O
're O
almost O
impossible O
to O
beat O
. O

Conversely O
, O
Georgia B-ORG
MUST O
be O
able O
to O
run O
the O
ball O
to O
set O
up O
play O
action O
and O
keep O
the O
pressure O
off O
of O
David O
Greene O
. O

- O
Mark O
Richt O
has O
proven O
to O
be O
a O
better O
on O
the O
fly O
adjustment O
coach O
that O
Tommy O
Tuberville O
. O

Tubs O
is O
famous O
for O
taking O
chances O
, O
often O
unnecessary O
ones O
. O

That O
history O
is O
of O
concern O
to O
me O
. O

While O
it O
's O
okay O
to O
try O
crazy O
shit O
when O
your O
team O
is O
under-rated O
or O
a O
serious O
underdog O
, O
it's O
important O
not O
to O
give O
games O
away O
when O
you O
're O
the O
favorite O
. O

Playing O
more O
'' O
by O
the O
book O
'' O
and O
a O
bit O
`` O
closer O
to O
the O
vest O
'' O
becomes O
the O
call O
for O
the O
day O
. O

Considering O
all O
of O
these O
factors O
, O
I O
truly O
believe O
that O
this O
is O
Auburn B-ORG
's O
year O
. O

They O
may O
not O
go O
undefeated O
and O
they O
may O
not O
get O
into O
the O
BCS B-ORG
title O
game O
, O
but O
they O
have O
enough O
talent O
, O
poise O
and O
experience O
to O
win O
this O
game O
. O

Auburn B-ORG
wins O
31-21 O
. O

And O
now O
that O
I O
have O
typed O
that O
prediction O
, O
I O
may O
just O
throw O

. O

MCCHRYSTAL O
It O
looks O
and O
feels O
like O
terrorism O
and O
what O
it O
requires O
is O
units O
to O
conduct O
forced O
production O
activities O
which O
they O
are O
prepared O
and O
do O
all O
the O
time O
but O
clearly O
when O
you O
see O
a O
tactic O
like O
this O
, O
it O
requires O
strict O
adherence O
or O
adjustments O
to O
your O
tactics O
, O
techniques O
and O
procedures O
to O
ensure O
that O
places O
like O
checkpoints O
are O
not O
vulnerable O
. O

So O
it O
won't O
change O
our O
overall O
rules O
of O
engagement O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
effect O
the O
operation O
at O
large O
but O
to O
protect O
our O
soldiers O
it O
clearly O
requires O
great O
care O
. O

PLANTE O
So O
certainly O
an O
unpleasant O
development O
today O
Judy O
and O
another O
item O
on O
the O
docket O
over O
here O
today O
is O
the O
failure O
of O
a O
number O
of O
cruise O
missiles O
. O

Tomahawk O
land O
detect O
missiles O
being O
from O
launched O
from O
ships O
in O
the O
eastern O
Mediterranean O
and O
in O
the O
Red B-LOC
Sea I-LOC
have O
suffered O
a O
number O
of O
failures O
. O

The O
Pentagon B-ORG
says O
a O
total O
of O
seven O
of O
the O
cruise O
missiles O
have O
failed O
crashing O
in O
Turkey B-LOC
and O
in O
Saudi B-LOC
Arabia I-LOC
. O

No O
injuries O
reported O
. O

The O
missiles O
are O
programmed O
so O
that O
they O
do O
n't O
detonate O
until O
they O
reach O
their O
target O
. O

If O
they O
go O
astray O
, O
then O
the O
warheads O
never O
arm O
but O
claiming O
that O
it O
's O
about O
one O
percent O
of O
the O
warheads O
. O

They O
've O
fired O
675 O
or O
so O
tomahawk O
land O
detect O
missiles O
from O
ships O
and O
seven O
of O
those O
have O
failed O
. O

Judy O
... O
WOODRUFF O
Chris O
, O
very O
quickly O
, O
new O
information O
from O
the O
Pentagon B-ORG
today O
about O
any O
concerns O
they O
have O
about O
Saddam O
Hussein O
's O
ongoing O
air O
defense O
capability O
? O

PLANTE O
Well O
, O
no O
major O
concern O
. O

The O
Pentagon B-ORG
says O
that O
they O
do O
have O
air O
dominance O
as O
they O
now O
call O
it O
over O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
the O
country O
that O
there O
are O
certain O
areas O
and O
only O
certain O
areas O
of O
downtown O
Iraq O
where O
battle O
management O
radars O
linked O
to O
surface O
to O
air O
missiles O
are O
still O
in O
tact O
. O

The O
reason O
that O
they O
're O
still O
in O
tact O
according O
to O
today O
's O
briefing O
was O
that O
they O
had O
not O
turned O
them O

and O
as O
long O
as O
they O
do O
n't O
turn O
them O
on O
, O
the O
U.S B-LOC
. O

trouble O
locating O
them O
. O

They O
assure O
us O
that O
as O
soon O
as O
they O
do O
start O
turning O
on O
these O
radars O
that O
they O
'll O
take O
those O

finish O

held O
on O
to O
the O
ball O

despite O
being O
disjoined O
from O
his O
helmet O
on O

After O
many O
minutes O
lying O
motionless O
on O

, O
Ferguson O
was O
finally O
removed O

The O
Packers B-ORG
went O
on O
to O
lose O
the O
game O

but O
that O
's O
not O
the O
story O
here O

This O
was O
not O
one O
of O
the O
staged O
stiff-armed O
clotheslines O
you O
see O
in O
professional O
wrestling O
broadcasts O
. O

This O
was O
a O
vicious O
, O
arm O
cocked O
and O
swinging O
clothesline O
that O
literally O
could O
have O
torn O
Ferguson O
's O
head O
off O
of O
his O
body O
. O

The O
play O
was O
immediately O
flagged O

and O
moments O
later O
it O
was O
announced O
that O
Darius O
had O
been O
ejected O
, O
much O
to O
the O
crowd O

delight O

One O
sidenote O
here O
is O
that O
, O
despite O
their O
rabid O
fandom O
and O
the O
situation O
, O
not O
one O
thing O
was O
thrown O
at O
the O
offending O
player O
as O
he O
left O
the O
field O

It O
would O
have O
been O
easy O
to O
bathe O
him O
in O
beer O
or O
snowballs O
or O
batteries O
as O
he O
left O
, O
but O
the O
Packer B-ORG
fans O
are O
classier O
than O
that O

To O
a O
person O
, O
they O
acted O
with O
class O
, O
using O
their O
voices O
and O
not O
projectiles O
to O
express O
their O
displeasure O
. O

This O
was O
the O
most O
vicious O
and O
blatantly O
dirty O
play O
I O
have O
seen O
in O
the O
NFL B-ORG
since O
Jim O
McMahon O
was O
body O
slammed O
to O
the O
ground O
in O
the O
mid O
80's O
about O
five O
seconds O
after O
he O
had O
released O
a O
pass O
. O

And O
Jaguars B-ORG
coach O
Jack O
Del O
Rio O
and O
Darius O
had O
the O
nerve O
to O
vociferously O
argue O
with O
officials O
about O
Darius O
' O
ejection O
from O
the O
game O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
care O
what O
anyone O
says O
about O
`` O
you O
ca O
n't O
judge O
intent O
. O
'' O

Darius' O
intent O
was O
to O
dismember O
, O
injure O
or O
even O
kill O
Ferguson O
. O

The O
more O
I O
saw O
the O
replay O
, O
the O
sicker O
it O
made O
me O
feel O
. O

The O
league O
must O
take O
action O
, O
and O
it O
must O
be O
swift O
and O
sure O
. O

I'm O
talking O
about O
a O
four O
game O
suspension O
that O
included O
the O
playoffs O
if O
necessary O
. O

In O
this O
day O
and O
age O
of O
bigger O
, O
stronger O
and O
faster O
players O
, O
injuries O
are O
going O
to O
happen O
accidentally O
all O
of O
the O
time O
. O

There O
is O
simply O
no O
room O
for O
the O
kind O
of O
play O
that O
resulted O
in O
Ferguson O
's O
injury O
. O

Paul O
Tagliabue O
must O
give O
word O
to O
all O
of O
his O
employees O
that O
actions O
like O
this O
will O
not O
be O
tolerated O
. O

Maybe O
that O
will O
tell O
the O
Jaguars B-ORG
, O
Darius O
and O
players O
like O
him O
that O
this O
kind O
of O
head-hunting O
will O
not O
be O
tolerated O
in O
the O
NFL B-ORG
. O

If O
not O
, O
I O
fully O
expect O
the O
Packers B-ORG
and O
many O
other O
teams O
to O
handle O
this O
matter O
`` O
on O

the O

had O
its O
day O
earlier O

it O

of O
the O
hottest O
stocks O
around O

over O

There O
's O
plenty O
of O
argument O
about O
the O
future O
of O
DVD O
and O
video O
rental O
, O
and O
Netflix B-ORG
represents O
a O
pure-play O
on O
one O
of O
the O
three O
dominant O
hypotheses O
: O
I O
. O

That O
business O
is O
O-V-E-R O
-- O
Between O
pay-per-view O
, O
video-on-demand O
, O
pirated O
movies O
, O
high-bandwidth O
Internet O
broadcasts O
, O
and O
the O
increasing O
availability O
of O
other O
media O
, O
it O
takes O
some O
faith O
to O
see O
any O
future O
for O
movie O
rentals O
. O

Those O
who O
do O
n't O
have O
the O
requisite O
faith O
will O
point O
to O
these O
factors O
as O
proof O
that O
the O
business O
is O
dying O
and O
the O
movie O
business O
in O
general O
will O
need O
a O
pretty O
significant O
overhaul O
before O
it O
can O
make O
profits O
. O

Movie O
rentals O
are O
no O
longer O
a O
cheap O
alternative O
to O
other O
ways O
of O
viewing O
films O
; O
they O
're O
the O
stodgy O
, O
expensive O
way O
. O

There O
are O
n't O
any O
pure-play O
buys O
on O
this O
theory O
, O
but O
someone O
who O
believes O
it O
might O
overweight O
their O
portfolio O
in O
cable O
companies O
-- O
if O
they O
purchased O
any O
media O
stocks O
at O
all O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
there O
have O
been O
companies O
whose O
performance O
would O
perfectly O
mimic O
the O
validity O
of O
this O
idea O

but O
Psuedo.com B-ORG

Not O
so O
fast O
-- O
it O
'll O
just O
go O
online O
! O

-- O
Anyone O
who O
wants O
to O
counter O
that O
argument O
would O
probably O
start O
by O
taking O
us O
back O
to O
1997 O
, O
when O
in O
terms O
of O
time O
used O
, O
text O
was O
the O
most O
popular O
kind O
of O
information O
online O
. O

At O
the O
time O
, O
and O
for O
years O
after O
, O
people O
argued O
that O
the O
traditional O
bookstore O
would O
become O
obsolete O
. O

After O
all O
, O
how O
could O
we O
stand O
for O
a O
rapaciously O
arborcidal O
medium O
like O
'books O
' O
or O
'newspapers' O
when O
we O
could O
transmit O
the O
same O
data O
as O
bits O
and O
bytes O
and O
save O
on O
transportation O
, O
too O
? O

As O
it O
turns O
out O
, O
of O
course O
, O
Amazon.com B-ORG
, O
BarnseandNoble.com B-ORG
, O
and O
a O
host O
of O
others O
simply O
took O
the O
bookstore O
model O
, O
attached O
a O
56K O

and O
declared O
themselves O
The O

Netflix B-ORG
is O
doing O
much O
the O

thing O

the O
traditional O

customer O

Who O
d'you O
think O
you O
're O
kidding O
? O

You O
ca O
n't O
kill O
movie O
rental O
stores O
-- O
So O
there O
's O
a O
big O
difference O
between O
movies O
and O
books O
: O
For O
books O
, O
the O
retail O
store O
is O
practically O
the O
sole O
medium O
of O
distribution O
; O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
sell O
through O
them O
, O
books O
wo O
n't O
get O
sold O
. O

For O
movies O
, O
the O
video O
rental O
store O
is O
just O
one O
way O
to O
get O
videos O
out O
there O
( O
though O
at O
45-55 O
% O
of O
studio O
revenues O
, O
it O
's O
a O
much O
more O
important O
one O
than O
people O
think O
) O
. O

But O
given O
the O
high O
valuations O
ascribed O
to O
bricks-and-mortar-and-dead O
tree O
booksellers O
like O
Barnes B-ORG
and O
Noble B-ORG
, O
Borders B-ORG
, O
and O
to O
a O
much O
lesser O
extent O
Books-A-Million B-ORG
, O
surely O
there's O
room O
for O
a O
Blockbuster B-ORG
, O
along O
with O
a O
Movie B-ORG
Gallery I-ORG
or O
two O
. O

The O
latter O
, O
at O
least O
, O
still O
has O
room O
to O
grow O
. O

By O
focusing O
on O
smaller O
, O
rural O
communities O
( O
preferably O
the O
sort O
that O
considers O
DSL O
'newfangled O
' O

Walmart B-ORG
's O
awful O
in-store O
video O

and O
much O
lower O
prices O
. O

The O
movie O
business O
is O
changing O
dramatically O
as O
the O
potential O
for O
online O
distribution O
grows O
, O
but O
like O
every O

it O
leaves O
lots O
of O

it O

when O
push O
came O
to O

the O

gave O
in O

accepted O
a O
salary O
cap O

, O
the O
sides O
were O
about O

NHL B-ORG
arena O
for O
every O
day O
of O
the O
next O
season O
so O
they O
understand O
what O
the O
fans O
go O
thru O
to O
see O
a O
hockey O
game O
. O

Then O
, O
all O
current O
contracts O
need O
to O
be O
voided O
by O
the O
end O
of O
the O
season O
in O
2006 O
. O

That O
means O
no O
team O
would O
own O
any O
player O
, O
and O
the O
owners O
would O
be O
free O
to O
sign O
whomever O
they O
'd O
like O
using O
the O
`` O
fiscal O
restraint O
'' O
they O
all O
droned O
on O
and O
on O
about O
all O
year O
. O

That O
way O
, O
they O
'd O
only O
pay O
as O
much O
as O
they O
could O
afford O
... O
right O
? O

Wrong O
. O

Those O
douchebags O
would O
end O
up O
overspending O
like O
every O
professional O
sports O
owner O
because O
they O
ca O
n't O
control O
themselves O
. O

If O
Mr. O
Iginla O
or O
Heatley O
were O
free O
agents O
, O
for O
example O
, O
owners O
would O
bid O
each O
other O
out O
of O
their O
minds O
, O
then O
they O
'd O
be O
left O
with O
not O
enough O
to O
get O
a O
competetive O
team O
. O

While O
the O
business O
model O
in O
the O
NHL B-ORG
was O
certainly O
flawed O
and O
the O
owners O
needed O
help O
, O
they O
really O
needed O
help O
to O
protect O
them O
from O
themselves O
. O

And O
the O
fact O
is O
that O
without O
that O
help O
, O
the O
owners O
would O
follow O
the O
same O
path O
that O
got O
them O
where O
they O
are O
right O
now O
anyway O
. O

The O
biggest O
issue O
is O
this O
, O
however O
. O

Very O
few O
people O
give O
one O
hot O
shit O
whether O
the O
NHL B-ORG
plays O
another O
game O
ever O
, O
let O
alone O
this O
season O
or O
the O
next O
one O
. O

For O
every O
crying O
Canuck O
there O
are O
1,000 O
or O
more O
others O
who O
say O
'' O
No O
hockey O
? O

Huh O
... O
did O
n't O
even O
notice O
. O
'' O

And O
the O
last O
television O
network O
interested O
in O
carrying O
hockey O
( O
ESPN B-ORG
) O
may O
opt O
out O
of O
televising O
the O
NHL B-ORG
next O
season O
, O
meaning O
that O
all O
of O
the O
teams O
would O
be O
in O
HUGE O
trouble O
, O
because O
no O
TV O
= O
no O
league O

Period O

Atlanta B-LOC

the O

it O

TV O

that O
pays O
the O

and O
the O

DO O
have O
a O

and O
no O

I O
'll O

this O
for O

when O
they O

now O
is O
a O

Why O

Making O

certainly O
a O

It O
can O

Should O
anyone O

because O
I O
just O
happen O

It O
turns O
out O
that O

outperformed O
a O

multiple O
measures O

This O

is O
particularly O
relevant O
for O

because O
the O
authors O
measured O
return O
after O

To O
often O
these O
studies O
use O
as O
a O
starting O
point O
the O
moment O
before O
information O
becomes O
public O
. O

The O
only O
way O
to O
benefit O
from O
such O
information O
is O
by O
holding O
the O
stock O
before O
the O
information O

This O

indicates O
that O

may O
still O
be O
useful O
even O

It O
might O
also O
be O

to O
look O
at O
companies O
that O
have O
consistently O
made O
the O
list O
in O
the O
previous O
few O
years O
and O
make O
an O
educated O
guess O
about O
their O
inclusion O
on O
this O
year O

list O
. O

Search O
the O
news O

and O
see O
if O
in O

the O

did O
anything O
that O

Will O
, O
I O
share O
your O
frustration O
at O
the O
reaction O
to O
Allen O
's O
nod O
to O
Spottswood O
Robins O
. O

Among O
some O
segments O
of O
the O
African-American O
community O
, O
it O
is O
indeed O
a O
matter O
of O
damned-if-you-do O
, O
damned-if-you-do O
n't O
. O

But O
you O
could O
say O
the O
same O
thing O
of O
the O
Democratic B-ORG
Party I-ORG
as O
a O
whole O
. O

I O
think O
it O
's O
important O
to O
recognize O
that O
African O
Americans O
, O
though O
still O
overwhelmingly O
Democratic O
, O
comprise O
less O
of O
a O
monolith O
than O
they O
did O
20-30 O
years O
ago O
. O

I O
find O
myself O
continually O
amazed O
at O
how O
open-minded O
many O
young O
African-Americans O
are O
. O

And O
I O
think O
that O
open-mindedness O
goes O
a O
long O
way O
to O
explain O
the O
desperate O
efforts O
of O
many O
( O
not O
all O
, O
but O
many O
) O
within O
the O
Democratic B-ORG
Party I-ORG
to O
circle O
the O
wagons O
with O
the O
cry O
of O
'' O
racism O
, O
racism O
, O
racism O
'' O
when O
the O
evidence O
of O
racism O
is O
increasingly O
a O
stretch O
. O

It O
's O
like O
how O
, O
after O
the O
Civil O
War O
, O
Republicans B-ORG
`` O
waved O
the O
bloody O
shirt O
'' O
, O
associating O
the O
Democratic B-ORG
Party I-ORG
with O
the O
secession O
and O
, O
ultimately O
, O
the O
war O
itself O
. O

Eventually O
, O
that O
tactic O
lost O
its O
power O
. O

And O
so O
, O
too O
, O
will O
the O
cries O
of O
racism O
, O

Biography O
of O
Jo-Ann O
Bellucci O
My O
biography O
changed O
completely O
5 O
years O
ago O
when O
I O
contracted O
a O
very O
severe O
case O
of O
fibromyalga O
. O

Usually O
I O
say O
nothing O
about O
it O
although O
it O
has O
severly O
limited O
my O
life O
, O
no O
truthly O
changed O
it O
completely O
! O

This O
time O
I O
decided O
to O
just O
say O
it O
up O
front O
and O
go O
back O
and O
talk O
about O
the O
good O
old O
days O
, O
when O
life O
was O
a O
kick O
! O

I O
now O
live O
in O
Watertown B-LOC
, O
MA B-LOC
, O
12 O
miles O
from O
Boston B-LOC
's O
Logan O
airport O
, O
in O
a O
lovely O
two O
family O
house O
I O
bought O
as O
an O
investment O
with O
my O
boss O
, O
my O
9 O
year O
old O
Yorkshire O
Terrier O
, O
Teddy O
! O

I O
just O
turned O
50 O
years O
old O
this O
Christmas O
. O

When O
I O
had O
a O
j.o.b O
. O

I O
ran O
a O
software O
company O
for O
a O
few O
years O
and O
then O
started O
my O
own O
company O
, O
Pinnacle B-ORG
Business O
Enterprises B-ORG
and O
was O
under O
a O
5 O
year O

doing O
a O
lot O
of O
interesting O
things O

Business O
Process O

mostly O
people O

the O
effect O

would O
have O
on O
them O

Showing O
them O
how O
to O
invite O
change O
into O
their O
lives O
because O
it O
freed O
them O
from O
the O
mundanne O
tasks O
and O
allowed O
them O
to O
use O
their O
great O
creativity O
instead O
of O
their O
backs O
. O

I O
'll O
get O
on O
to O
the O
more O

( O

just O
one O
business O

Those O
of O
you O
in O
Louisianna B-LOC
are O
very O
familiar O
with O
what O
used O
to O
be O
The O
Akzo O

On O

one O
day O

unexpectedly O
, O
they O
dressed O
me O
up O
in O
safety O
equipment O
and O
ran O
me O
down O
the O
mine O
shaft O
. O

I O
mention O
this O
because O
I O
never O
really O
got O
over O
, O
after O
that O
, O
how O
much O
we O
take O
advantage O
of O
evryday O
things O
... O
like O
the O
salt O
on O
our O
tables O
or O
the O
rock O
salt O
that O
keeps O
the O
northern O
cities O
moving O
in O
the O
winter O
! O

After O
I O
learned O
how O
to O
breath O
with O
my O
emergency O
apparatice O
I O
was O
driven O
around O
to O
see O
the O
manufacturing O

. O

I O
'm O

we O
are O
all O
familiar O

those O
Yellow O

play O

move O

Then O
there O
was O
the O
class O
action O
suit O
against O
Gateway B-ORG
brought O
by O
some O
Philadelphia B-LOC
lawyers O
a O
number O
of O
years O
ago O
. O

Gateway B-ORG
advertised O
and O
stickered O
many O
of O
its O
486 O
computers O
as O
`` O
Pentium O
Ready O
'' O
, O
meaning O
that O
a O
special O
Type O
3 O
ZIF O
socket O
Pentium O
OverDrive O
could O
be O
installed O
and O
run O
. O

Micronics B-ORG
designed O
the O
motherboards O
used O
by O
Gateway B-ORG
, O
and O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
design O
was O
a O
prototype O
Pentium O
OverDrive O
with O
an O
internal O
write-through O
cache O
, O
a O
more O
conservative O
cache O
design O
. O

Then O
Intel B-ORG
changed O
the O
Pentium O
OverDrive O
, O
and O
the O
final O
version O
had O
a O
write-BACK O
cache O
. O

When O
installed O
in O
a O
Gateway B-ORG
system O
, O
the O
chip O
ran O
slower O
than O
slow O
, O
maybe O
about O
as O
fast O
as O
an O
IBM B-ORG
AT O
, O
and O
bus-mastering O
devices O
like O
NICs O
and O
SCSI O
cards O
refused O
to O
work O
. O

So O
the O
lawyers O
sued O
Gateway B-ORG
, O
and O
the O
settlement O
approved O
by O
the O
judge O
consisted O
of O
megabucks O
for O
the O
lawyers O
and O
coupons O
to O
owners O
of O
Gateway B-ORG
486 O
computers O
. O

The O
coupon O
was O
good O
for O
$ O
50 O
off O
on O
the O
purchase O
of O
a O
Pentium O
OverDrive O
processor O
from O
Gateway B-ORG
, O
at O
its O
usual O
inflated O
prices O
! O
! O
! O

So O
, O
let O
's O
see O
. O

What O
does O
a O
discount O
coupon O
for O
a O
processor O
I O
can't O
use O
in O
my O
system O
do O
for O
me O
? O

I O
wonder O
how O
many O
people O
gleefully O
cashed O
in O
their O
coupons O
and O
bought O
Pentium O
OverDrives O
from O
Gateway B-ORG
. O

Intel B-ORG
eventually O
compensated O
by O
making O
available O
an O
`` O
interposer O
'' O
, O
a O
little O
socketed O
thingie O
installed O
between O
the O
Pentium O
OverDrive O
and O
the O
ZIF O
socket O
. O

The O
sole O
purpose O
of O
the O
interposer O
was O
to O
raise O
a O
signal O
on O
the O
CPU O
to O
force O
its O
cache O
to O
operate O
in O
the O
write-thru O
mode O
which O
was O
compatible O
with O
most O
ZIF O
Socket O
3 O
486 O
motherboards O
. O

Needless O
to O
say O
, O
this O
was O
the O
least O
successful O
`` O
OverDrive O
'' O
CPU O
ever O
done O
by O
Intel B-ORG
. O

The O
486-DX4 O
OverDrive O
was O
OK O
, O
as O
were O
several O
Socket O
5 O
Pentium O
OverDrives O
and O
the O
Socket O
8 O
Pentium O
Pro O
OverDrive O
. O

Finally O
Intel B-ORG
gave O
up O
on O
OverDrives O

The O
violence O
erupted O
after O

endured O
withering O
criticism O
Monday O
from O
members O
of O
his O
own O
Likud B-ORG
Party I-ORG
over O
his O
Cabinet O
's O
acceptance O
of O
the O
U.S.-backed B-LOC
`` O
road O
map O
'' O
peace O
plan O
. O

Sharon O
indicated O
a O
180-degree O
turnaround O
after O
decades O
of O
warning O
that O
an O
Israeli B-LOC
withdrawal O
from O
even O
small O
parts O
of O
the O
West B-LOC
Bank I-LOC
could O
endanger O
Israel B-LOC
's O
existence O
. O

Skeptics O
, O
however O
, O
wondered O
whether O
Sharon O
's O
conversion O
was O
a O
shrewd O
effort O
to O
deflect O
U.S B-LOC
. O

pressure O
in O
the O
hopes O
the O
road O
map O
would O
fail O
before O
Israel B-LOC
had O
to O
make O
tough O
concessions O
. O

`` O
To O
keep O
3.5 O
million O
people O
under O
occupation O
is O
bad O
for O
us O
and O
them O
, O
'' O
Sharon O
said O
in O
remarks O
broadcast O
on O
Israel B-ORG
Radio I-ORG
. O

The O
term O
`` O
occupation O
'' O
is O
anathema O
to O
the O
Israeli B-LOC
right O
, O
which O
believes O
Israel B-LOC
has O
a O
legitimate O
claim O
to O
the O
West B-LOC
Bank I-LOC
and O
Gaza B-LOC
Strip I-LOC
for O
religious O
and O
security O
reasons O
. O

Palestinians O
and O
their O
dovish O
Israeli B-LOC
allies O
routinely O
use O
the O
word O
`` O
occupation O
'' O
when O
demanding O
that O
Israel B-LOC
leave O
the O
West B-LOC
Bank I-LOC
and O
Gaza B-LOC
and O
dismantle O
Jewish O
settlements O
. O

Palestinians O
claim O
all O
of O
the O
West B-LOC
Bank I-LOC
and O
Gaza B-LOC
for O
a O
state O
. O

On O
Sunday O
, O
Sharon O
's O
Cabinet O
conditionally O
approved O
the O
`` O
road O
map O
, O
'' O
a O
three-phase O
plan O
that O
begins O
with O
a O
halt O
to O
violence O
and O
envisages O
a O
Palestinian O
state O
in O
the O
West B-LOC
Bank I-LOC
and O
Gaza B-LOC
Strip I-LOC
in O
2005 O
. O

Sharon O
told O
party O
critics O
he O
was O
committed O
to O
finding O
a O
political O
solution O
to O
the O
conflict O
, O
including O
an O
Israeli B-LOC
withdrawal O
from O

`` O

Likud B-ORG

that O
the O

was O
slanted O
in O

of O

In O
his O

Monday O
, O
Sharon O

`` O

Critics O
have O
said O
Sharon O
's O
long-held O
condition O
that O
all O
violence O
must O
stop O
before O
peace O
moves O
is O
unrealistic O
and O
guarantees O
failure O
of O
any O

thus O
releasing O
him O
from O
the O

Liberal O

Yossi O

Sharon O

keep O
his O

murky O
to O
persuade O
the O

that O

BEGALA O
Mr. O
King O
, O
thanks O
for O
stying O
with O
us O
through O

break O

One O
of O
the O
reasons O
that O
we O
like O
having O
you O
on O
, O
and O
as O
well O
as O
Mr. O

, O
is O
that O
, O
you O
know O
, O
this O
is O
war O
, O
as O
we O
were O
saying O
in O
the O
last O
segment O
. O

You O
treat O
it O
with O
the O
gravity O
and O
the O
seriousness O
that O
it O
deserves O
. O

And O
you O
're O
a O
congressman O
who O
has O
put O
his O

his O
country O
ahead O
of O
his O
partisan O

So O
I O
wonder O
if O
you O
'll O
join O
Charlie O
Rangel O
, O
who O
put O
out O
a O
press O
release O
today O
, O
decrying O
the O
Republican B-ORG
attempt O

Is O

that O
wrong O

KING O
The O
important O
thing O
is O
that O
the O
bill O
pass O
for O
the O
military O
. O

If O
the O
other O
stuff O
's O
in O
there O
, O
it O
's O
there O
. O

I O
mean O
to O
me O
, O
the O
main O
purpose O
should O
be O
the O
military O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
going O
to O
disagree O
with O
Charlie O
's O
point O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
often O
when O
bills O
are O
passed O
, O
there O
are O
things O
attached O
to O
them O
. O

So O
to O
me O
, O
the O
key O
thing O
is O
that O
we O
ought O
to O
be O
taking O
care O
of O
the O
military O
and O
that O
's O
what O
we O
should O
do O
. O

to O
a O
lesser O
extent O
Berlin B-LOC

than O
it O

`` O

to O
make O

legitimate O

'' O

Most O
analysts O
linked O
Russia B-LOC

opposition O
to O
a O
war O
in O

to O
fears O
that O
it O
will O
lose O

sealed O
with O
the O
now-toppled O

of O

The O
floodgates O
of O

are O
also O
now O
likely O
to O
open O

heavily O

few O
at O
the O

be O
hurt O
by O
Russia B-LOC

apparent O
diplomacy O
failures O

Putin O
will O
face O
re-election O
in O
March O
2004 O
and O
analysts O
noted O
that O
the O
war O
-- O
while O
opposed O

most O
Russians O
-- O
was O
never O
turned O
by O
the O
Kremlin B-LOC

a O
matter O

`` O

we O

she O

Ca O
n't O
you O
think O
? O

G. O
LYNCH O
Yes O
, O
a O
bunch O
, O
but O
my O
mind O
's O
blank O
. O

The O
doctor O
has O
completed O
one O
surgery O
on O
her O
back O
. O

They O
have O
released O
the O
pressure O
on O
a O
nerve O
, O
and O
realigned O
all O
the O
disks O
and O
put O
plates O
and O
stuff O
in O
it O
, O
and O
that O
was O
because O
she O
did O
n't O
have O
any O
feeling O
in O
her O
feet O
. O

So O
he O
, O
he O
's O
pretty O
sure O
right O
now O
that O
that O
will O
relieve O
, O
relieve O
the O
tension O
, O
and O
her O
feet O
will O
be O
able O
to O
move O

Also O
, O
we O
have O
heard O
and O
seen O
reports O
that O
she O
had O
multiple O
gunshot O
wounds O

and O
knife O

. O

The O
doctor O
has O
not O
seen O
any O
of O
this O
. O

He O
looked O
for O
the O
gunshot O
wounds O
for O
the O
knife O

, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
injury O
whatsoever O

They O
will O

her O
right O

And O
we O
are O
just O

D. O
LYNCH O
We O
talked O
to O
her O
before O

after O
the O
surgery O
, O
like O
I O
said O
, O
and O
she's O
just O
, O
she O
just O
sounded O
real O
good O

Of O
course O
, O
this O
morning O
she O
was O
a O
little O
groggy O
. O

But O
yet O
, O
she O
was O
good O
, O
because O
it O
was O
early O
. O

And O
then O
this O
afternoon O
, O
after O
the O
surgery O
, O
she O
was O
our O
Jessie O
again O
. O

QUESTION O
If O
those O
were O
n't O
gunshot O
wounds O
to O
cause O
the O
broken O
bones O
, O
do O
they O
know O
what O
caused O
the O
fractures O
? O

G. O
LYNCH O
They O
have O
no O
idea O
at O
this O
time O
what O
caused O
them O

We O
know O
she O

in O
good O
spirits O
, O
because O
they O
told O
her O
they O
was O
gon O
na O
put O
pink O
casts O
on O
her O
legs O
and O
arms O
, O
and O
she O
had O
pink O
casts O
when O
she O
was O
in O
the O
third O
grade O
on O
her O
arm O
so O
we O
know O
she O
-- O
her O
mind O
is O
working O
good O
. O

So O
she O
's O
in O
good O
spirits O
, O
and O
we O
hope O
the O
surgery O
will O
go O
good O
tomorrow O
, O
just O
as O
well O
as O
it O
did O
today O
. O

QUESTION O
Can O
you O
tell O
us O
what O
she O
said O
to O
you O
on O

You O
said O
she O

Can O

Shiite O

Iraq B-LOC
Monday O
celebrated O
openly O
for O
the O
first O
time O
in O

Prophet O

birthday O
, O
as O
continuing O
anarchy O
and O

threatened O
to O
undermine O
US B-LOC
efforts O
to O
rebuild O
the O
war-ravaged O
country O
. O

Meanwhile O
coalition O
officials O
in O
Iraq B-LOC
insisted O
plans O
for O
an O
Iraqi B-LOC
government O
were O
still O
on O
track O

Russia B-LOC
hinted O
that O
a O

on O
a O
UN B-ORG

to O
lift O

Thousands O
of O
Iraq B-LOC

majority O
Shiite O
Muslims O
marched O
to O
their O
main O
mosque O
in O
Baghdad B-LOC

mark O
the O
birthday O
of O

celebrate O

were O
forbidden O
to O
publicly O
mark O
the O
date O
under O
the O
regime O
of O
Saddam O
Hussein O
's O
Sunni-dominated O
regime O

The O
crowd O
filled O
the O
street O
leading O
to O
the O
Kazimiya O
mosque O
in O
the O
northeast O
of O
Baghdad B-LOC
and O
carried O
banners O
in O
the O
green O

of O

calling O
for O

`` O

chanted O
the O

from O
a O
platform O

Imam O
Mohammad O
al-Fartussi O

who O
last O

threatened O

against O
'' O
sinful O

women O

and O
cinemas O
showing O
`` O

offered O
praise O
for O

called O
Iraq B-LOC
`` O

'' O

The O
demonstration O
came O
as O
Iraq B-LOC
's O
top O
US B-LOC
overseer O
Paul O
Bremer O
began O
his O
second O
week O
on O
the O
job O
amid O
continuing O
lawlessness O
in O
the O
country O
. O

In O
his O
frenzied O
first O
seven O
days O
, O
the O
telegenic O
Bremer O
repeatedly O
promised O
to O
restore O
the O
law O
and O
order O
that O
crumbled O
along O
with O
Saddam O
Hussein O
's O
regime O
nearly O
six O
weeks O

. O

But O
despite O
issuing O
a O
host O
of O
tough O
decrees O
, O
Bremer O
has O
failed O
to O
stem O
the O
rampant O
crime O
and O
street O
violence O
plaguing O
the O
country O
. O

Despite O
a O
security O
crackdown O
over O
the O
weekend O
in O
Baghdad B-LOC
and O
an O
announcement O
that O
some O
7,000 O
policemen O
had O
returned O
to O
their O
jobs O
since O
the O
end O
of O
the O
war O
, O

In O
Baghdad B-LOC
, O
almost O
all O
the O
police O
stations O
have O
been O
destroyed O
or O

since O
US B-LOC

took O

Only O

they O
have O
no O

Baghdad B-LOC

top O
police O
job O
remains O
vacant O
. O

And O
a O
trip O
to O
Baghdad B-LOC
's O
looter O
market O
only O
bears O
witness O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
criminals O
are O
ruling O
the O
roost O
in O
the O

Packed O

a O

`` O

given O
the O
circumstance O
in O
that O
area O
right O
now O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
even O
know O
if O
they O
would O
have O
been O
able O
to O
pull O
it O
off O
, O
you O
know O
? O

Joe O
Well O
, O
uh O
, O
so O
he O
, O
in O
fact O
he O
wasn't O
James O
Pardon O
me O
? O

Joe O
so O
, O
um O
-- O
no O
, O
so O
he O
was O
n't O
buried O
in O
Jerusalem B-LOC
. O

James O
No O
. O

No O
, O
they O
buried O
him O
-- O
uh O
, O
inside O
that O
compound O
. O

Joe O
Oh O
, O
I O
see O
. O

James O
Yeah O
, O
they O
buried O
him O
inside O
that O
compound O
. O

But O
like O
you O
say O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
-- O
I O
personally O
-- O
uh O
-- O
would O
n't O
have O
seen O
a O
problem O
with O
it O
, O
but O
-- O
I O
just O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
was O
feasible O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
that O
they O
would O
have O
been O
-- O
uh O
, O
secure O
enough O
to O
really O
do O
it O
. O

I O
don't O
think O
either O
side O
would O
have O
really O
-- O
let O
it O
happen O
-- O
and O
-- O
and O
as O
far O
as O
a O
senior O
U.S B-LOC
. O

official O
going O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
that O
would O
have O
been O
necessary O
either O
. O

Um O
, O
I O
know O
President O
Bush O
should O
n't O
have O
went O
-- O
and O
he O
was O
n't O
going O
. O

Joe O
Well O
, O
I O
kind O
of O
feel O
, O
I O
kind O
of O
feel O
another O
way O
. O

I O
think O
a O
senior O
U.S B-LOC
. O

service O
in O
there O
, O
should O
have O
been O
there O
, O
because O
I O
mean O
-- O
he O
, O
Arafat O
's O
been O
-- O
been O
the O
one O
coming O
to O
all O
these O
peace O
talks O
, O
you O
know O
, O
with O
President O
Clinton O
and O
, O
you O
know O
, O
other O
James O
Mhm O
. O

Joe O
other O
um O
-- O
litigations O
towards O
that O
. O

James O
Mhm O
. O

Joe O
You O
know O
, O
I O
think O
, O
I O
think O
we O
could O
have O
just O
showed O
our O
face O
and O
said O
you O
know O
, O
yeah O
, O
we O
do O
recognize O
this O
man O
. O

James O
Mhm O
. O

Well O
it O
, O
they O
sent O
someone O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
who O
it O
was O
-- O
( O
( O
It O
was O
n't O
) O
) O
Joe O
It O
probably O
, O
it O
was O
n't O
anybody O
important O
. O

It O
was O
just O
like O
a O
James O
Yeah O
it O
was O
an O
under O
secretary O
, O
there O
's O
no O
doubt O
about O
it O
. O

There O
was O
no O
senior O
Joe O
James O
there O
was O
no O
senior O
U.S B-LOC
. O

official O
there O
. O

There O
's O
there O
's O
no O
question O
about O
that O
. O

Joe O
Yeah O
. O

James O
But O
, O
uh O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
uh O
, O
Bush O
's O
policy O
-- O
towards O
, O
uh O
, O
Yasser O
Arafat O
has O
been O
hands O
off O
Joe O
Yeah O
. O

James O
from O
from O
the O
beginning O
cause O
I O
do O
n't O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
he O
ever O
even O
met O
with O
him O
. O

Did O
he O
? O

Joe O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
so O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
so O
. O

James O
Yeah O
, O
I O
I O
Joe O
Bush O
is O
kind O
of O
like O
, O
staying O
away O
from O
the O
whole O
Israel B-LOC
-- O
Palestinian B-LOC
James O
Mhm O
. O

Now O
on O
his O
part O
I O
think O
that O
was O
a O
mistake O
. O

Joe O
Yeah O
. O

James O
Yeah O
, O
you O
know O
you O
got O
to O
engage O
people O
in O
some O
type O
of O
dialogue O
Joe O
And O
James O
if O
you O
Joe O
to O
me O
, O
the O
talk O
, O
the O
peace O
talks O
should O
have O
continued O
-- O
after O
Clinton O
's O
administration O
left O
. O

James O
True O
. O

Joe O
Cause O
at O
the O
cause O
at O
the O
end O
Clinton O
was O
doing O
all O
this O
peace O
talk O
with O
Arafat O
and O
, O
um O
James O
True O
. O

Mhm O
. O

Joe O
( O
( O
forget O
) O
) O
the O
um O
, O
prime O
minister O
in O
Israel B-LOC
, O
but O
he O
was O
talking O
to O
him O
. O

James O
Uh O
, O
Sharon O
. O

Joe O
Sharon O
, O
yeah O
. O

James O
Yeah O
. O

Mhm O
. O

Joe O
They O
were O
doing O
all O
these O
talks O
in O
Camp O
David O
and O
and O
it O
should O
have O
just O
continued O
when O
Br- O
Bush O
came O
into O
office O
. O

James O
You O
're O
absolutely O
right O
. O

I O
agree O
. O

Like O
I O
said O
, O
I O
think O
that O
was O
one O
of O
Bush O
's O
biggest O
mistakes O
, O
Joe O
Mhm O
. O

James O
not O
continuing O
-- O
the O
talks O
. O

Because O
Clinton O
had O
came O
so O
very O
close O
Joe O
Yes O
. O

James O
to O
to O
maybe O
getting O
some O
type O
of O
agreement O
Joe O
No O
. O

James O
but O
, O
uh O
, O
Bush O
just O
took O
a O
hands O
off O
approach O
. O

He O
just O
-- O
kind O
of O
took O
a O
hands O
off O
approach O
. O

Joe O
And O
now O
the O
situation O
in O
, O
you O
know O
, O
Jerusalem B-LOC
and O
the O
West B-LOC
Bank I-LOC
is O
just O
-- O
escalated O
. O

James O
Absolutely O
. O

And O
I O
think O
too O
-- O
Israel B-LOC
's O
-- O
position O
toward O
Arafat O
-- O
in O
terms O
of O
keeping O
him O
sort O
of O
like O
-- O
uh O
-- O
surrounded O
in O
that O
compound O
-- O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
that O
was O
a O
good O
idea O
. O

Joe O
No O
. O

James O
You O
know O
, O
because O
that O
, O
you O
ca O
n't O
pick O
a O
leader O
for O
a O
people O
. O

Whether O
you O
like O
them O
or O
not O
-- O
people O
get O
to O
choose O
who O
they O
want O
to O
follow O
, O
Joe O
Exactly O
. O

James O
and O
the O
Palestinians B-LOC
had O
made O
it O
clear O
-- O
that O
Arafat O
was O
their O
leader O
. O

Joe O
Exactly O
. O

James O
So O
, O
I O
think O
that O
they O
, O
we O
should O
have O
found O
a O
way O
-- O
Israel B-LOC
should O
have O
found O
a O
way O
-- O
to O
-- O
keep O
some O
type O
of O
dialogue O
-- O
going O
along O
. O

Cause O
uh O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
you O
look O
at O
what O
's O
going O
on O
now O
. O

Joe O
Mhm O
. O

James O
I O
mean O
, O
their O
policy O
toward O
him O
did O
n't O
get O
them O
anything O
. O

And O
then O
you O
got O
suicide O
bombing O
on O
the O
one O
side O
, O
and O
then O
you O
got O
Israel B-LOC
-- O
you O
know O
, O
it O
's O
like O
one O
day O
, O
you O
'll O
he- O
a O
bomb O
will O
go O
off O
, O
the O
next O
day O
Israel B-LOC
will O
do O
and O
air O
strike O
and O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
it O
's O
like O
going O
around O
in O
a O
circle O
. O

Joe O
Yeah O
. O

James O
It O
's O
like O
going O
around O
in O
a O
circle O
. O

Joe O
It O
's O
really O
a O
bad O
situation O
. O

James O
It O
is O
. O

It O
is O
, O
and O
it O
's O
, O
it O
's O
been O
so O
long O
-- O
going O
on O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
you're O
talking O
about O
something O
that O
's O
been O
going O
on O
historically O
for O
hundreds O
of O
years O
. O

Joe O
Hundreds O
of O
years O
and O
then O
, O
it O
just O
recently O
really O
come O
into O
spectrum O

James O
Mhm O

Joe O
what O
, O

When O

Mark O

I O
am O
36 O

I O
've O

around O

I O
'm O
not O

anything O

I O
've O
seen O
some O
things O
in O
my O
life O
. O

I O
have O
initially O
agreed O

disagreed O
with O
different O
things O
over O
the O
years O
, O
only O
to O
have O
my O
mind O
changed O
later O
. O

However O
, O
I O
will O
never O
EVER O
change O
my O
mind O
about O
the O
idiocy O
we O
call O
Daylight O
Savings O
Time O
. O

I O
Googled O
`` O
Daylight O

and O
I O
got O
the O
following O
link O
: O
http O
: O
//webexhibits.org/daylightsaving/ O
I O
started O
reading O
... O

The O
site O
says O
things O
like O
`` O
We O
've O
learned O
to O
save O

and O
enjoy O
sunny O
summer O

there O

no O

It O
should O
be O
Daylight O

My O
apologies O
to O
the O
assclowns O
that O
invented O
this O
idiocy O
and O
the O
goobers O
that O
perpetuate O
it O
in O
such O
a O
ridiculous O
fashion O
. O

I O
will O
concede O
that O
`` O
springing O
forward O
'' O
and O
`` O
falling O
back O
'' O
are O
good O
ways O
to O
remember O
to O
change O
the O
batteries O
in O
your O
smoke O

. O

However O
, O
New O
Years O
and O
the O
Fourth O
of O
July O
would O
do O
the O
same O
thing O
. O

I O
kept O
reading O
the O
website O
of O
propoganda O
and O
found O
that O
the O
first O
person O
to O
come O
up O
with O
the O
idea O
was O
Benjamin O
Franklin O
who O
did O
it O
on O
behalf O
of O
some O
friends O
that O
owned O
oil O
companies O
( O
oil O
was O
used O
in O
lamps O
) O
. O

I O
assume O
that O
, O
because O
the O
idea O
was O
dumb O
and O
inconvenient O
, O
lots O
of O
people O
ignored O
it O
. O

`` O
By O
1966 O
, O
some O
100 O
million O
Americans O
were O
observing O
DST O
based O
on O
their O
own O
local O
laws O

customs O
. O

Congress B-ORG
decided O
to O
step O
in O
to O
end O
the O
confusion O
and O
establish O
one O
pattern O
across O
the O
country O

The O

me O

a O

of O
a O
lawsuit O

eliminate O

tragic O

the O

have O
been O
, O
it O
is O
truly O
uplifting O

their O

so O
generously O
responded O
to O
the O
call O

at O
an O
unprecedented O
rate O
, O
in O
some O
cases O
by O
millions O

`` O

the O
fourth O

Although O
the O

still O
continuing O

some O
individual O

have O
announced O

unfortunate O

I O
've O
worked O
with O
them O
in O

was O
very O
impressed O
with O
the O

They O
also O

in O
the O

where O
they O
continue O
to O
work O
which O
needs O
plenty O

too O
- O
quite O
an O
important O
reminder O
because O
other O
needy O
areas O
of O
the O
world O
are O
getting O
less O
donations O
now O
. O

So O
they O
did O
n't O
discourage O
donations O
to O
them O
per O
se O
, O
just O
not O
for O
this O
specific O

I O
realize O

most O

will O
want O

where O
the O
need O

it O

the O

I O

no O

you O
could O

well O

you O

more O

Christina O
Okay O
, O
I O
-- O
have O
been O
following O
the O
trial O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
why O
, O
ever O
since O
this O
whole O
thing O
happened O
. O

I O
am O
a O
stay O
at O
home O
mom O
, O
so O
I O
get O
to O
watch O
the O
~TV O
more O
often O
, O
and O
I O
-- O
you O
know O
have O
been O
fo- O
-- O
watching O
all O
these O
forensic O
pathologists O
, O
Dr. O
Henry O
Lee O
. O

You O
know O
, O
and O
and O
what O
I O
see O
is O
that O
there O
is O
no O
physical O
evidence O
that O
he O
did O
it O
. O

And O
yeah O
, O
it O
sounds O
like O
he O
did O
do O
it O
because O
he O
dyed O
his O
hair O
, O
was O
trying O
to O
get O
away O
, O
and O
the O
anchor O
and O
a O
boat O
. O

But O
there O
's O
-- O
-- O
I O
for O
some O
reason O
, O
deep O
down O
in O
my O
heart O
, O
do O
n't O
believe O
he O
did O
it O
. O

And O
you O
know O
and O
I O
think O
the O
media O
made O
him O
guilty O
, O
and O
I O
think O
-- O
it O
's O
like O
you O
know O
, O
I O
mean O
you O
saw O
what O
happened O
outside O
the O
courtroom O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
you O
did O
or O
not O
, O
see O
how O
they O
were O
cheering O
on O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
he's O
guilty O
and O
, O
I O
hope O
he O
does O
n't O
get O
the O
death O
penalty O
. O

And O
-- O
I O
don't O
know O
. O

I O
I O
just O
do O
n't O
think O
he O
's O
guilty O
. O

I O
think O
he O
's O
wrong O
, O
what O
he O
did O
, O
everything O
, O
he O
cheated O
on O
his O
wife O
, O
that O
's O
so O
wrong O
, O
but O
-- O
that O
does O
n't O
make O
him O
a O
murderer O
, O
he O
's O
just O
a O
cheater O
, O
he O
's O
just O
a O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
like O
one O
hundred O
ten O
percent O
you O
know O
eighteen O
karat O
-- O
asshole O
, O
like O
i- O
Mar- O
Mark O
Geragos O
called O
him O
. O

Greg O
Yeah O
. O

Christina O
How O
about O
you O
? O

You O
probably O
think O
he O
's O
guilty O
, O
or O
Greg O
Well O
-- O
Yeah O
, O
no O
I O
, O
I O
think O
, O
I O
think O
( O
( O
the O
guy O
's O
) O
) O
definitely O
guilty O
uh O
Just O
based O
on O
, O
I O
have O
n't O
followed O
it O
all O
that O
closely O
, O
although O
you O
ca O
n't O
help O
but O
follow O
it O
closely O
because O
there O
's O
so O
much O
crap O
on O
the O
news O
. O

Christina O
Mhm O
. O

Greg O
But O
uh O
no O
i- O
the O
-- O
uh O
the O
I O
think O
well O
first O
of O
all O
, O
you O
know O
I O
agree O
with O
you O
, O
I O
think O
cheating O
on O
your O
wife O
's O
pretty O
low O
. O

But O
I O
think O
what O
happened O
i- O
it O
's O
living O
the O
b- O
uh O
living O
large O
. O

You O
could O
tell O
both O
of O
them O
uh O
you O
look O
some O
of O
the O
things O
they O
had O
, O
you O
know O
, O
he O
had O
a O
few O
bucks O
or O
so O
. O

( O
( O
) O
) O
finish O
, O
things O
were O
getting O
him O
down O
, O
uh O
you O
know O
, O
you O
know O
how O
it O
is O
, O
day O
after O
day O
though O
-- O
M- O
marriage O
isn't O
all O
that O
wonderful O
. O

Christina O
Right O
. O

Greg O
Eh O
, O
you O
know O
and O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
he O
had O
faced O
that O
, O
and O
plus O
, O
you O
know O
, O
a O
lot O
of O
the O
neat O
stuff O
from O
the O
outside O
, O
and O
particularly O
Amber O
Frey O
, O
who O
I O
do O
n't O
particularly O
think O
is O
neat O
, O
but O
it O
was O
something O
that O
uh O
you O
know O
he O
went O
after O
Christina O
Mhm O
. O

Greg O
and O
so O
uh O
he O
figured O
, O
well O
-- O
these O
will O
, O
these O
things O
would O
get O
rid O
of O
her O
I O
guess O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
why O
like O
his O
uh O
, O
the O
wife O
's O
or O
the O
mother O
said O
divorce O
is O
an O
option O
I O
think O
. O

Christina O
Yeah O
. O

I O
know O
, O
that O
's O
very O
powerful O
. O

Not O
, O
you O
know O
, O
not O
murder O
and O
, O
oh O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

Greg O
But O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
I O
I O
can O
see O
, O
the O
guy O
was O
n't O
thinking O
right O
. O

He O
was O
screwed O
up O
, O
you O
know O
, O
a O
despicable O
human O
being O
and O
he O
, O
just O
-- O
You O
know O
, O
the O
easy O
way O
out O
. O

This O
'll O
work O
, O
I O
guarantee O
I O
'm O
too O
damn O
smart O
. O

Christina O
But O
you O
know O
what O
, O
it O
's O
like O
I O
think O
they O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
find O
him O
guilty O
because O
remember O
when O
~OJ O
was O
not O
found O
guilty O
? O

I O
mean O
, O
oh O
my O
God O
, O
the O
, O
you O
know O
, O
but O
it O
's O
like O
, O
~LA B-LOC
would O
have O
like O
, O
turned O
~LA B-LOC
upside O
down O
, O
like O
all O
the O
, O
you O
know O
Greg O
Yeah O
. O

Christina O
I- O
it O
just O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
would O
happen O
if O
he O
was O
found O
guilty O
, O
but O
now O
I O
think O
they O
said O
that O
they O
wanted O
to O
prove O
that O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
okay O
, O
we O
're O
not O
going O
to O
let O
this O

Well O

I O
have O
yet O
to O
hear O
that O
scientists O
from O
any O
other O
country O
even O
made O
the O
attempt O
the O
American B-LOC

made O
. O

Perhaps O
the O
Indonesian B-LOC
government O
should O
have O
taken O
steps O
to O
set O
up O
a O
hotline O
of O
sorts O
that O
could O
be O
used O
in O
case O
of O
such O
emergencies O
. O

As O
the O
article O
notes O
, O
the O
American B-LOC
scientists O
did O
not O
know O
who O
to O
contact O
. O

That's O
hardly O
their O

A O

How O

it O

So O
he O
picks O

then O
checks O
his O

. O

Finally O
, O
the O

says O
`` O
I O

have O
to O
put O
him O
down O

'' O

`` O
What O
? O

Because O
he O

`` O
