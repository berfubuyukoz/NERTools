up O

" O

bring O

it O

the O

still O
not O
decided O
how O
much O
stipend O
residents O
will O
be O
entitled O
to O
. O

dr O
sadashivamurthy O
said O
it O
would O
be O
much O
less O
than O
what O
residents O
in O
central O
government O
hospitals O
get O
. O

once O
the O
residency O
scheme O
is O
put O
in O
place O
junior O
doctors O
will O
be O
able O
handle O
cases O
on O
their O
own O
and O
will O
be O
made O
responsible O
that O
those O
cases O
. O

but O
the O
state O
of O
affairs O
among O
private O
junior O
doctors O
is O
not O
likely O
to O
change O
. O

said O
a O
junior O
doctor O
in O
a O
private O
hospital O
, O
" O
government O
hospital O
junior O
doctors O
have O
a O
voice O
, O
we O
do O
n't O
. O

our O
biggest O
problem O
is O
stipend O
. O

it O
's O
a O
pittance O
after O
all O
the O
years O
that O
we O
have O
put O
in O
for O
studies O
. O

but O
we O
have O
no O
way O
to O
vent O
our O
grievances O
. O
" O
she O
said O
the O
problem O
is O
not O
so O
acute O
in O
big O
private O
hospitals O
because O
at O
least O
they O
get O
enough O
work O
. O

but O
in O
smaller O
hospitals O
junior O
doctors O
do O
not O
get O
paid O
, O
they O
have O
to O
sign O
bonds O
for O
continued O
service O
and O
do O
not O
even O
get O
much O
work O
. O

junior O
doctors O
have O
also O
been O
protesting O
against O
rural O
service O
but O
the O
government O
feels O
they O
must O
be O
prepared O
for O
just O
a O
couple O
of O
years O
' O
service O
. O
" O
the O
government O
has O
made O
their O
education O
highly O
subsidised O
and O
the O
least O
they O
can O
do O
is O
put O
in O
two O
years O
of O
rural O
service O
before O
they O
their O
post O
graduation O
. O

those O
who O
do O
this O
service O
get O
preference O
for O
pg O
selection O
. O

often O
they O
say O
they O
'll O
do O
it O
after O

then O
they O
are O
either O
off O

a O

that O

hire O

the O

ratio O

the O
patient O
intake-student O
ration O
in O
a O

. O

it O
has O
also O
put O
a O
ceiling O
of O
150 O
students O

in O

" O

to O
these O
unscrupulous O
methods O
so O
that O
they O
can O
increase O
their O

intake O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

the O
only O
way O
to O
stop O
such O
practices O
is O
by O
the O
authorities O
to O
make O
their O
inspections O
" O
real O

not O
they O
are O
conducted O
now O
and O
also O
take O
stern O
, O
exemplary O
action O
against O
erring O
institutes O
. O

a O
big O
problem O
for O
medical O
students O
in O
the O
country O
today O
is O
to O
get O
into O

. O
" O
in O
certain O

the O

is O
even O
greater O

even O
if O

no O

you O
will O
get O

the O

you O
want O

moreover O
, O
pg O

if O
you O
do O

there O
is O

they O
say O
unless O

improved O
in O
the O

the O

they O

quite O

the O

all O
we O
have O
heard O

a O
whimper O
from O

amarsinh O
chaudhary O

he O
said O
somewhere O
that O
the O

nothing O

of O

what O
about O

? O

in O
the O
week O
following O
the O
unveiling O
of O
the O
tehelka O
tapes O
, O
a O
senior O
bjp O
mp O
told O
this O
correspondent O
rather O
contemptuously O
: O
" O
these O
congress O

are O
absolutely O
useless O

if O
we O
were O
in O
their O
place O
you O
would O
have O
seen O
the O
way O
we O
unleashed O
our O
campaign O
. O
" O
he O
was O
talking O
of O
congressmen O
in O
gujarat O
who O
were O
making O
an O
apology O
of O
an O
attempt O
to O
embarrass O
the O

. O

the O
same O
was O
the O
case O
when O
the O
madhavpura O

out O

but O
try O
telling O
congress O
leaders O
of O
the O
state O
that O
they O
look O
like O
a O
passenger O
train O
destined O
for O
nowhere O
, O
and O
you O
will O
probably O
provoke O
violent O
reactions O
similar O
to O
what O
principals O
of O
Ahmedabad LOC

got O
from O
Nsui ORG

on O
thursday O

for O
the O

the O
Nsui ORG

student O
wing O

ever O
since O
the O

captured O
power O
in O
the O
panchayat O

last O
year O
, O
party O

have O
been O
on O
cloud O
nine O

it O
is O
a O
foregone O
conclusion O
that O
we O
will O
come O
to O
power O
with O
a O
thumping O
majority O
in O
the O
next O
assembly O
election O
, O
is O
what O
congress O
men O
have O
been O
asserting O
since O
then O
. O

the O
keshubhai O
government O
is O
so O
corrupt O
and O
everybody O
is O
so O
fed O
up O
with O
them O
that O
nobody O
will O
vote O
for O
the O
bjp O
, O
they O
aver O
. O

but O
is O
this O
something O
that O
is O
so O
certain O
? O

performance-wise O
keshubhai O
has O
little O
to O
write O
home O
about O
. O

neither O
is O
the O
government O
expected O
to O
qualitatively O
improve O
its O
performance O
over O
the O
remaining O
period O
of O
its O
life O
. O

but O
elections O
are O
not O
fought O
on O
performance O
alone O
. O

if O
your O
competitor O
looks O
worse O
than O
you O
, O
then O
chances O
are O
that O
you O
might O
be O
voted O
back O
, O
whatever O
be O
your O
performance O
. O

ask O
the O
left O

in O
calcutta O

they O
might O
reveal O
how O
replacing O
jyoti O
basu O
with O

one O
which O
shone O
compared O
with O

the O

well O
be O
hurt O
the O
most O
by O

worthy O
shankersinh O
vaghela O

a O

the O

never O

full O

in O

if O

, O
he O
is O
feeling O
restive O
ever O

there O
is O
nothing O
more O
that O

it O
