the O

It O

Virginia. PER
There O 
just O

about O 
this O

so O

is O 
there O 
have O

a O 
lot O

problems O 
with O 
credibility O 
from O 
this O

Our O

has O 
repeatedly, O 
for O

relied O 
on O 
a O 
man O 
whom O 
you're O 
aware, O 
Hussein PER
Kamel, PER
Saddam PER
Hussein's PER
son-in-law, O 
leader O 
of O 
the O 
Iraq O 
arms O

who O 
defected O 
for O 
a O 
time. O 
And O 
gave O 
us O 
a O 
whole O 
lot O 
of O 
information O 
and O 
then O 
went O 
home O 
and O 
his O 
father-in-law O 
killed O 
him. O 
Bad O 
move. O 
But O 
while O 
he O

here, O 
he O 
gave O 
us O 
a O 
whole O

of O 
information. O 
Gave O 
us O 
a O 
whole O 
lot O 
of O 
information. O 
Well, O 
our O 
president O 
told O 
us O 
that O 
information O 
proves O 
that O 
the O 
dictator O 
had O 
chemical O 
weapons, O 
which O 
is O 
true. O 
But O 
what O 
we O 
just O

this O

from O

which O 
got O

is O 
that O 
he O 
also O 
told O

it O 
was O 
destroyed O 
back O 
in O 
1995. O 
Why O 
hasn't O 
our O

do O 
we O

idiot O 
to O 
go O 
back O

let O 
his O 
father-in-law O

the O 
things O 
that... O 
BEGALA O

what O

But, O 
this O

Well, O 
I've O

figures. O 
Once O

are, O 
what O 
the O

how O

might O

the O 
possibility O

what O 
Americans O

Over O 
80,000 O

220 O 
every O

die O 
from O 
medical O 
negligence, O

the O

companies O 
which O 
had O 
relatively O 
steady O 
rates O 
on O 
doctors O 
for O 
about O 
10 O

a O

That's O 
why O 
we O 
founded O 
the O 
National ORG
Patient ORG
Safety ORG
Foundation. ORG
The O 
current O 
system O 
doesn't O 
measure O

It O 
measures O 
disability. O

what O 
we're O 
finding O 
now O 
is O 
that O 
the O 
emergency O 
rooms O 
are O

trauma O 
centers O

pregnant O 
women O 
can't O

there O 
were O 
no O

neurosurgeons O 
available O

The O 
patient O 
had O 
to O 
be O 
airavacked O 
and O 
by O 
that O 
time O 
it O 
was O 
too O

of O 
a O 
child? O 
PALMISANO O 
Well, O 
what O 
has O 
to O 
be O 
done O 
here O 
is O 
balance. O 
What O 
we O 
need O 
is O 
a O 
system O 
that's O 
fair O

everyone, O 
a O

that O 
keeps O 
the O 
physicians O

allows O 
patients O 
to O 
have O 
access O 
to O 
physicians O 
in O 
their O 
hour O 
of O 
need. O

Back O

Hayworth, PER

Republican O

NOVAK O 
Congressman O 
Sanders, PER
you're O 
opposed O 
to O 
this O 
war. O 
I'm O 
not O 
crazy O 
about O 
it O 
myself. O 
But O 
I O 
want O 
to O 
ask O 
you O 
a O 
question. O 
When O 
the O 
guns O 
begin O 
to O 
fire, O 
when O 
the O 
American O 
men O 
and O 
women O 
are O 
in O 
harm's O 
way O 
and O 
may O 
be O 
dying, O 
is O 
that O 
now O 
the O 
time O 
for O 
you O 
and O 
your O 
allies O 
to O 
shut O 
up O 
and O 
support O 
the O

(APPLAUSE) O 
SANDERS O 
Well O 
it's O 
not O 
-- O 
are O 
you O 
suggesting O 
that O 
when O 
tens O 
and O 
thousands O 
of O 
Iraqi O 
women O 
and O 
children O 
are O 
killed, O 
and O 
when O 
young O 
men O 
and O 
women O 
in O 
this O 
country O 
are O 
unnecessarily O 
put O 
at O 
harm's O 
risk, O 
what O 
should O 
we O 
do? O 
The O 
answer O 
is, O 
these O 
are O 
my O 
neighbors O 
from O 
Vermont O 
and O 
obviously O 
we're O 
going O 
to O 
support O 
them. O 
And O 
obviously O 
we're O 
going O 
to O 
pray O 
that O 
there's O 
fewer O 
casualties... O 
NOVAK O 
Are O 
you O 
going O 
to O 
demonstrate O 
against O 
them O 
in O 
the O 
streets? O 
SANDERS O 
No, O 
I O 
don't O 
demonstrate O 
against O 
anybody O 
during O 
a O 
war. O 
But O 
let's O 
be O 
clear. O 
The O 
president O 
almost O 
unilaterally O 
is O 
putting O 
us O 
in O 
this O 
position O 
against O 
world O 
opinion. O 
NOVAK O 
Didn't O 
the O 
Congress ORG
support O 
it? O 
I O 
thought O 
you O 
voted O 
for O 
it. O 
SANDERS O 
I O 
did O 
not O 
vote O 
for O 
it. O 
NOVAK O 
I O

the O 
Congress. ORG
The O 
majority O 
rules. O 
SANDERS O 
Yes. O 
The O 
Congress ORG
gave O 
him O 
authority, O 
but O 
the O 
American O 
people O 
disagreed O 
with O 
the O 
decision. O 
NOVAK O 
Not O 
according O 
to O 
the O

BEGALA O 
Congressman O 
Hayworth, PER
back O 
to O 
a O 
comment. O 
And O 
I O 
know O 
that O 
you O 
meant O 
it O

I O 
agreed O 
with O 
it. O 
You O 
said, O 
"This O 
is O 
Saddam PER
Hussein, PER

Baghdad." O 
I'm O 
curious, O 
would O 
that O 
have O 
accurately O 
described O 
him O 
in O 
1988? O 
HAYWORTH O 
Oh, O 
yes. O 
I O 
think O 
it O 
does. O 
I O 
think O 
it O 
has O 
described O 
him, O 
especially O 
since O 
he's O 
taken O 
basically O 
a O 
one-man O 
rule O 
over O 
with O 
the O 
Baath ORG
Party ORG
in O 
1979. O 
BEGALA O 
I O 
agree. O 
Therefore, O 
wasn't O 
Dick PER

as O 
the O 
CEO O 
of O

wrong O 
to O 
be O 
selling O

HAYWORTH O 
I O 
don't O 
know O

any O

Saddam PER
Hussein. PER
What O 
I O

BEGALA O 
I O 
can O 
tell O 
you O 
about O 
it O

HAYWORTH O 
That's O

to O 
Saddam PER

(CROSSTALK) O 
HAYWORTH O 
What O

is O 
Saddam PER

has O 
butchered O

And O 
to O 
somehow O 
try O

we O

danger. O 
BEGALA O 
Would O 
you O 
have O 
treated O 
him O 
as O 
a O 
customer, O 
the O 
way O 
Dick PER

did? O 
HAYWORTH O 
I O 
don't O 
even O

BEGALA O 
Would O 
you O 
have O 
sold O 
oilfield O

to O 
him? O 
(CROSSTALK) O 
SANDERS O 
Furthermore, O 
the O 
United O

supported O 
him O 
in O 
the O 
war O 
against O 
Iran. O 
HAYWORTH O 
Yes. O 
Hello? O 
Iran O 
had O 
hostages. O 
Seventy-nine O 
Americans O 
were O 
held O 
hostage. O 
SANDERS O 
Hello? O 
Hello? O 
We're O 
talking... O 
(CROSSTALK) O 
SANDERS O 
What O 
we're O 
talking O 
about O 
is O 
the O 
unpredictable O 
nature O 
of O 
war O 
and O 
what O 
could O 
happen O 
in O 
this O 
war. O 
For O 
example O 
-- O 
wait O 
a O 
second O 
-- O 
in O 
Iran, O 
the O 
reason O 
that O 
you O 
had O 
Ayatollah O 
Khomeini PER
in O 
power O 
is O 
he O 
overthrew O 
the O 
Shah. O 
You O 
who O 
put O 
the O 
Shah O 
in O 
power? O 
The O 
United O 
States O 
of O 
America. O 
HAYWORTH O 
Oh O 
the O 
evil O 
United O

SANDERS O 
But O 
the O 
point O 
is... O 
NOVAK O 
I O 
want O 
to O 
get O 
to O 
that O 
point. O 
But O 
the O 
problem O 
with O 
Khomeini PER
was O 
that O 
the O 
guy O 
who O 
he O 
overthrew O 
was O 
put O 
in O 
power O 
by O 
the O 
United O 
States. O 
I O 
can't O 
quite O 
figure O 
that O 
out. O 
SANDERS O 
We O 
overthrew O 
(UNINTELLIGIBLE) O 
and O 
put O 
the O 
Shah O 
of O 
Iran O 
in O 
power. O 
Everybody O 
knows O 
that. O 
The O 
CIA ORG
did O 
that. O 
NOVAK O 
But O 
I O 
mean O 
you're O 
attacking O 
the O 
CIA ORG
for O 
putting O 
him O 
in, O 
when O 
it O 
was O 
-- O 
the O 
problem O 
was O 
Khomeini. PER
SANDERS O 
No, O 
the O 
point O 
I O 
made, O 
Khomeini PER
came O 
about O 
because O 
we O 
put O 
a O 
brutal O 
dictator, O 
the O 
Shah O 
of O 
Iran, O 
in O 
power. O 
The O 
point O 
that O 
I O 
am O 
making O 
is O 
you O 
cannot... O 
HAYWORTH O 
The O 
point O 
you're O 
making O 
is O 
blame O 
America O 
first. O 
SANDERS O 
No O 
I'm O 
not. O 
HAYWORTH O 
That's O 
what O 
you're O 
doing. O 
SANDERS O 
You're O 
talking O 
about O 
blowback. O

a O 
daddy. O 
But O 
first, O 
our O 
own O 
little O 
moonwalk O 
across O 
the O 
political O 
landscape, O 
the O 
"CROSSFIRE O 
Political O 
Alert." O 
The O 
foreign O 
ministers O 
of O 
France, O 
Germany O 
and O 
Russia O 
today O 
issued O 
a O 
joint O 
declaration O 
that O 
they O 
will O 
not O 
allow O 
a O 
second O 
American-backed O 
resolution O 
to O 
pass O 
the O 
United ORG
Nations ORG
Security O 
Council. O 
President O 
Bush PER
wants O 
the O 
Security O 
Council O 
to O 
explicitly O 
authorize O 
force O 
against O 
Iraq, O 
and O 
his O 
press O 
secretary O 
today O 
remained O 
optimistic O 
that O 
in O 
the O 
end, O 
that's O 
just O 
what O 
he'll O 
get. O 
President O 
Bush PER
is O 
said O 
to O 
be O 
focusing O 
on O 
one O 
fence-sitting O 
Security O 
Council O 
member, O 
the O 
African O 
nation O 
of O 
Guinea, O 
because O 
he O 
said O 
-- O 
quote O 
-- O 
"I O 
used O 
to O 
have O 
one O 
of O 
their O 
pigs." O 
So O 
-- O 
OK, O 
I O 
made O 
that O 
up. O 
He O 
didn't O 
say O 
that. O 
TUCKER O 
CARLSON, O 
CNN O 
CO-HOST O 
Well, O 
I O 
suspected O 
that. O 
You O 
know... O 
BEGALA O 
But O 
they O 
are O 
a O 
swing O 
vote. O 
Guinea O 
is O 
an O 
important O 
swing O 
vote. O 
CARLSON O 
As O 
is O 
Cameroon. O 
France O 
and O 
Germany O 
are O 
pointing O 
to O 
inspection O 
and O 
saying, O 
Look, O 
they're O 
working. O 
We O 
don't O 
need O 
war. O 
They're O 
not O 
pointing O 
out O 
that O 
inspections O 
are O 
working O 
only O 
because O 
there's O 
the O 
credible O 
threat O 
of O 
war. O 
Saddam PER
wouldn't O 
be O 
destroying O 
missiles O 
unless O 
he O 
thought O 
he O 
was O 
going O 
to O 
be O 
destroyed O 
if O 
he O 
didn't. O 
BEGALA O 
I O 
think O 
that's O 
a O 
good O 
point. O 
It O 
doesn't O 
mean O 
we O 
have O 
to O 
go O 
to O 
war. O 
But O 
I O 
think O 
President O 
Bush PER
should O 
get O 
credit O 
for O 
pushing O 
to O 
instructions O 
and O 
backing O 
them O 
up O 
with O 
the O 
threat O 
of O 
force. O 
CARLSON O 
It O 
means O 
when O 
you O 
take O 
the O 
threat O 
of O 
force O 
of O 
the O 
table, O 
you're O 
likely O 
to O 
stop O 
disarming O 
Saddam PER
Hussein. PER
BEGALA O 
Yes, O 
I'm O 
not O 
saying O 
take O 
the O 
threat O 
of O 
force. O 
I'm O 
saying O 
we O 
don't O 
need O 
to O 
use O 
force O 
right O 
now. O 
CARLSON O 
Well, O 
France O 
and O 
Germany O 
would O 
like O 
to. O 
Secretary O 
of O 
State O 
Colin PER
Powell PER
today O 
responded O 
to O 
Saddam PER
Hussein's PER
latest O 
attempts O 
to O 
fool O 
the O 
world. O 
Powell PER
called O 
Iraqi O 
steps O 
toward O 
disarmament O 
-- O 
quote O 
-- O 
"too O 
little, O 
too O 
late" O 
gestures, O 
meant O 
to O 
split O 
international O 
resolve O 
to O 
force O 
Baghdad O 
to O 
give O 
up O 
its O 
weapons O 
of O 
mass O 
destruction. O 
U.S. O 
intelligence O 
said O 
Powell PER
indicates O 
Iraq O 
has O 
hidden O 
equipment O 
to O 
produce O 
al-Samoud O 
2 O 
missiles, O 
even O 
as O 
it O 
destroys O 
existing O 
ones, O 
missiles O 
that O 
until O 
recently, O 
it O 
claimed O 
not O 
to O 
have. O 
Powell PER
also O 
revealed O 
that O 
Iraq O 
is O 
hiding O 
chemical O 
and O 
biological O 
weapons O 
in O 
poor O 
neighborhoods O 
around O 
Baghdad. O 
In O 
order O 
to O 
secure O 
peace, O 
Powell PER
concluded, O 
the O 
international O 
community O 
must O 
confront O 
Saddam PER
Hussein's PER
refusal O 
to O 
disarm O 
-- O 
quote O 
-- O 
"here O 
and O 
now." O 
So, O 
there O 
you O 
have O 
it. O 
The O 
essence O 
of O 
the O 
American O 
case O 
for O 
war O 
against O 
Saddam PER
Hussein. PER
The O 
only O 
question O 
left: O 
who O 
do O 
you O 
believe? O 
Secretary O

Colin PER
Powell PER
or O 
France? O 
BEGALA O 
No, O 
the O 
question O 
is... O 
CARLSON O 
That O 
is O 
the O 
question. O 
BEGALA O 
Who O 
do O 
you O 
believe: O 
the O 
Bush PER
administration O 
or O 
your O 
lying O 
eyes? O 
We O 
are O 
watching O 
them O 
destroy O 
weapons, O 
as O 
the O 
president O 
says, O 
Oh, O 
that's O 
just O 
a O 
hoax. O 
CARLSON O 
But O 
Paul... PER
BEGALA O 
They O 
are O 
disarming. O 
CARLSON O 
No, O 
no, O 
no O 
that's O 
not O 
what O 
the O 
president's O 
saying. O 
He's O 
saying, O 
the O 
-- O 
it's O 
a O 
hoax O 
to O 
the O 
extent O 
that O 
those O 
are O 
only O 
a O 
small O 
number O 
of O 
the O 
weapons O 
there. O 
Keep O 
in O 
mind, O 
these O 
are O 
weapons O 
that O 
Saddam PER
Hussein, PER
until O 
recently, O 
said O 
he O 
didn't O 
even O 
have. O 
He's O 
a O 
liar. O 
BEGALA O 
Of O 
course. O 
CARLSON O 
And O 
to O 
trust O 
Saddam PER
Hussein PER
in O 
effort O 
to O 
disarm O 
him O 
-- O 
foolish O 
task, O 
don't O 
you O 
think? O 
BEGALA O 
Absolutely. O 
Nobody O 
trusts O 
Saddam PER
Hussein. PER
The O 
question O 
is, O 
Is O 
he O 
a O 
sufficient O 
threat O 
to O 
America O 
today O 
to O 
risk O 
the O 
lives O 
of O 
our O 
young O 
men O 
and O 
women. O 
CARLSON O 
That's O 
a O 
separate O 
question. O 
That's O 
a O 
very O 
separate O 
question. O 
BEGALA O 
I O 
think O 
he's O 
not. O 
I O 
think O 
the O 
inspections O 
can O 
work. O 
CARLSON O 
That's O 
a O 
different O 
argument. O 
We O 
can O 
take O 
it O 
up O 
later. O

it's O 
there. O 
I O 
mean O 
to O

the O 
main O 
purpose O 
should O 
be O 
the O

So O 
to O

the O 
key O 
thing O 
is O 
that O 
we O

that O

MCCHRYSTAL O 
It O 
looks O 
and O 
feels O

what O 
it O 
requires O

units O

which O 
they O 
are O 
prepared O

do O 
all O

clearly O 
when O

a O

it O

It's O

there's O

The O 
Iraqis O

looked O 
bemused O 
(ph) O 
and O 
plead O 
innocence O 
but O 
with O 
many O 
militia O 
here, O

to O 
surrender O 
only O 
to O 
open O 
fire O 
on O 
their O

later, O

This O

They're O 
not O 
the O

and O 
they're O 
unlikely O 
to O 
be O 
the O

The O 
Marines O 
believe O 
they O 
have O 
a O 
firm O 
hold O 
on O 
Umm O 
Qasr O 
right O 
now O 
but O 
they O 
can't O 
afford O 
to O 
slack O 
in O 
their O

and O 
allow O 
those O 
who O 
are O 
hostile O 
to O 
the O

to O 
regroup O

KEN O 
POLLACK, O 
CENTER O 
FOR O 
MIDDLE O 
EAST O 
POLICY, O 
BROOKINGS O 
INSTITUTION O 
Right. O 
I O 
mean O 
we're O 
seeing O 
one O 
of O 
the O 
great O 
advantages O 
of O 
U.S. O 
and O 
British O 
forces O 
now, O 
Judy, PER
which O 
is O 
that O 
they're O 
superbly O 
trained O 
troops. O 
They O 
have O 
training O 
in O 
a O 
whole O 
variety O 
of O 
different O 
missions O 
and O 
they're O 
adapting. O 
They O 
recognize O 
now O 
they O 
went O 
in O 
with O 
some O 
false O 
assumptions O 
about O 
the O 
kind O 
of O 
reception O 
that O 
they O 
were O 
going O 
to O 
face. O 
The O 
plan O 
that O 
was O 
implemented O 
had O 
some O 
inherent O 
risks O 
in O 
it, O 
risks O 
to O 
the O 
supply O 
line, O 
risks O 
in O 
terms O 
of O 
not O 
clearing O 
cities O 
and O 
they're O 
shifting. O 
They're O 
changing O 
and O 
the O 
troops O 
are O 
trained O 
well O 
enough O 
to O 
be O 
able O 
to O 
deal O 
with O 
that. O 
You've O 
seen O 
U.S. O 
Central ORG
Command ORG
bringing O 
up O 
additional O 
forces O 
like O 
the O 
82nd ORG
Airborne ORG
Division ORG
to O 
better O 
deal O 
with O 
these O 
long O 
supply O 
lines, O 
get O 
control O 
over O 
the O 
cities O 
and O 
so O 
I O 
think O 
that O 
U.S. O 
and O 
British O 
forces O 
are O 
beginning O 
to O 
stabilize O 
the O 
battlefield. O 
WOODRUFF O 
So O 
as O 
an O 
onlooker, O 
as O 
somebody O 
who's O 
studied O 
the O 
Iraqi O 
capabilities, O 
is O 
it O 
your O 
sense O 
that O 
the O 
coalition O 
can O 
continue O 
to O 
adjust O 
to O 
whatever O 
they O 
deal O 
with? O 
POLLACK O 
Absolutely. O 
One O 
of O 
the O 
things O 
I O 
think O 
we're O 
likely O 
to O 
see O 
is O 
that O 
the O 
Iraqis O 
are O 
going O 
to O 
have O 
a O 
tougher O 
time O 
adapting O 
than O 
U.S. O 
forces O 
are. O 
Typically O 
what O 
you've O 
seen O 
in O 
the O 
Iraqi O 
armed O 
forces O 
is O 
the O 
change O 
has O 
to O 
come O 
from O 
the O 
top. O 
It O 
doesn't O 
come O 
from O 
the O 
ground O 
up. O 
You O 
don't O 
have O 
ground O 
commanders O 
calling O 
back O 
and O 
saying O 
hey, O 
we'd O 
like O 
to O 
try O 
this O 
tactic O 
or O 
this O 
seems O 
to O 
work. O 
Tell O 
everybody O 
else O 
to O 
do O 
the O 
same O 
thing. O 
Instead O 
the O 
high O 
command O 
has O 
to O 
identify O 
a O 
problem, O 
come O 
up O 
with O 
a O 
solution O 
and O 
transmit O 
it O 
down. O 
Chances O 
are O 
the O 
Iraqis O 
are O 
going O 
to O 
continue O 
to O 
stick O 
with O 
what O 
we've O 
seen O 
before, O 
irregular O 
forces O 
blending O 
in O 
with O 
civilians O 
trying O 
to O 
attack O 
U.S. O 
forces, O 
some O 
more O 
of O 
these O 
suicide O 
attacks O 
which O 
are O 
going O 
to O 
be O 
problematic O 
for O 
our O 
troops. O 
There's O 
no O 
way O 
around O 
that O 
but O 
U.S. O 
forces, O 
British O 
forces O 
are O 
beginning O 
to O 
adapt O 
to O 
it. O 
WOODRUFF O 
I O 
want O 
to O 
ask O 
you O 
about O 
you O 
mentioned O 
coalition O 
forces O 
going O 
in O 
expecting O 
more O 
support O 
from O 
ordinary O 
Iraqi O 
people. O 
I O 
just O 
interviewed O 
a O 
gentleman, O 
native O 
of O 
Iraq, O 
who O 
talks O 
to O 
his O 
family O 
there O 
all O 
the O 
time O 
and O 
he O 
says O 
they O 
live O 
in O 
Baghdad O 
20, O 
30, O 
50 O 
of O 
them O 
and O 
he O 
said O 
they O 
do O 
the O 
view O 
the O 
Americans O 
as O 
invaders. O 
They O 
hate O 
Saddam PER
Hussein. PER
They O 
don't O 
like O 
what O 
he's O 
doing O 
but O 
they O 
don't O 
think O 
the O 
Americans O 
are O 
the O 
answer. O 
POLLACK O 
All O 
right. O 
Well, O 
this O 
is O 
something O 
that O 
we've O 
been O 
trying O 
to O 
get O 
a O 
grip O 
on O 
for O 
years, O 
exactly O 
what O 
the O 
Iraqi O 
people O 
feel O 
and O 
also O 
that O 
I O 
think O 
the O 
best O 
evidence O 
that O 
we O 
had O 
before O 
the O 
attack O 
began O 
was O 
that O 
Iraqis O 
do, O 
they O 
despise. O 
They O 
are O 
desperate O 
to O 
be O 
rid O 
of O 
him O 
but O 
by O 
the O 
same O 
token, O 
they O 
don't O 
like O 
another O 
country O 
coming O 
into O 
their O 
country O 
to O 
overturn O 
the O 
government O 
and O 
beyond O 
that, O 
I O 
think O 
it's O 
probably O 
most O 
important O 
for O 
most O 
Iraqis O 
is O 
they're O 
deeply O 
suspicious O 
of O 
the O 
United O 
States. O 
They O 
remember O 
that O 
the O 
United O 
States O 
betrayed O 
them O 
in O 
1991. O 
The O 
U.S. O 
didn't O 
finish O 
Saddam PER
then. O 
President O 
Bush PER
- O 
then O 
President O 
Bush PER
called O 
on O 
them O 
to O 
rise O 
up O 
and O 
then O 
the O 
U.S. O 
did O 
nothing O 
and O 
so O 
they're O 
deeply O 
suspicious O 
of O 
what O 
we O 
have O 
in O 
mind. O 
WOODRUFF O 
Which O 
raises O 
questions O 
going O 
forward. O 
One O 
last O 
thing, O 
Ken PER
Pollack PER
I O 
want O 
to O 
ask O 
about O 
this O 
British O 
officials O 
saying O 
that O 
they O 
have O 
information O 
that O 
Saddam PER
Hussein PER
has O 
fired O 
his O 
air O 
defense O 
chief. O 
What's O 
the O 
significance O 
of O 
that? O 
POLLACK O 
Well, O 
if O 
it's O 
true O 
and O 
obviously O 
we O 
don't O 
know O 
just O 
yet O 
but O 
if O 
it's O 
true, O 
it O 
is O 
very O 
significant O 
because O 
it's O 
effectively O 
the O 
Iraqis O 
admitting O 
that O 
many O 
of O 
the O 
civilian O 
casualties O 
that O 
we've O 
seen O 
over O 
the O 
last O 
few O 
days O 
may O 
in O 
fact O 
have O 
been O 
caused O 
by O 
Iraqi O 
surface O 
to O 
air O 
missiles O 
falling O 
back O 
to O 
ground O 
in O 
residential O 
areas. O 
WOODRUFF O 
(INAUDIBLE) O 
POLLACK O 
Exactly, O 
in O 
that O 
market O 
and O 
I O 
think O 
it O 
was O 
pretty O 
apparent O 
when O 
you O 
looked O 
at O 
the O 
video O 
of O 
that O 
market, O 
if O 
that O 
had O 
been O 
a O 
U.S. O 
bomb O 
or O 
a O 
U.S. O 
cruise O 
missile, O 
that O 
market O 
would O 
have O 
been O 
obliterated. O 
Chances O 
are O 
it O 
was O 
an O 
Iraqi O 
surface O 
to O 
air O 
missile. O

we've O

planes O 
we O 
can O 
hear O

cannot O

have O 
been O

the O

Five O 
huge O

an O

as O

Not O 
just O

in O

to O 
that O 
in O 
the O

about O 
28 O

some O 
massive O 
blasts O 
to O

it O 
appears O 
that O 
this O

in O 
this O 
area O 
continues O 
and O 
we O 
have O 
really O 
seen O 
the O 
most O

it O 
is O 
on O 
the O 
ground O 
that O 
the O 
coalition O

are O 
going O 
after O 
there? O 
WEDEMAN O 
Well, O 
basically O 
on O 
the O 
ridge O 
itself O 
it O 
is O 
the O 
most O 
forward O 
Iraqi O 
army O 
positions O 
and O 
we've O 
been O 
watching O 
them O 
very O 
closely O 
for O 
the O 
last O 
month O 
prior O 
to O 
the O 
war O 
to O 
the O 
outbreak O 
of O 
the O 
war O 
and O 
basically O 
these O 
are O 
the O 
positions O 
that O 
control O 
this O 
entire O 
valley. O 
Up O 
there O 
they O 
have O 
heavy O 
machine O 
guns. O 
They O 
have O 
mortars. O 
They O 
have O 
anti-tank O 
guns, O 
hundreds O 
of O 
men O 
along O 
this O 
very O 
long O 
ridge O 
that O 
basically O 
runs O 
from O 
the O 
north O 
to O 
the O 
south. O 
In O 
addition O 
to O 
that, O 
we O 
know O 
that O 
further O 
back O 
behind O 
those O 
lines O 
in O 
the O 
direction O 
of O 
Mosul O 
there O 
is O 
heavy O 
artillery O 
and O 
tanks O 
as O 
well, O 
this O 
according O 
to O 
the O 
people O 
here O 
in O 
this O 
area, O 
the O 
local O 
Kurds O 
who O 
have O 
been O 
going O 
across O 
the O 
lines O 
for O 
many O 
years O 
basically O

Now O 
precisely O 
what O 
they're O 
hitting O 
to O 
the O 
south O 
of O

is O 
unclear O

my O 
understanding O

that O 
there O 
are O

CORRESPONDENT O 
As O 
our O 
convoy O 
rolled O 
through O 
southern O 
Iraq O 
the O 
desperation O 
of O 
the O 
people O 
here O 
soon O 
became O 
evident. O 
In O 
trucks O 
and O 
on O 
foot O 
they O 
came O 
to O 
the O 
town O 
of O 
Safwan. O 
These O 
people O 
have O 
been O 
without O 
food O 
or O 
water O 
supplies O 
since O 
the O 
war O 
began. O 
Now O 
they O 
are O 
desperate. O 
Within O 
seconds O 
the O 
Kuwaiti O 
aid O 
workers O 
who O 
had O 
organized O 
this O 
trip O 
were O 
overpowered O 
by O 
the O 
mob. O 
These O 
desperate O 
scenes O 
are O 
exactly O 
what O 
the O 
aide O 
agencies O 
wanted O 
to O 
avoid. O 
This O 
is O 
survival O 
of O 
the O 
fittest. O 
Only O 
the O 
healthy O 
and O 
strong O 
can O 
get O 
to O 
the O

The O 
weak O 
and O 
the O 
ill O 
are O 
left O 
with O 
nothing. O 
Despite O 
this O

to O

resentment O 
is O 
never O

As O

the O

Delivery O

One O 
of O

We, O

It's O 
simply O 
too O 
dangerous. O 
This O

Well O

this O

the O 
largest O

really O 
we've O 
seen O 
of O 
the O 
support O 
the O 
troops O 
rallies O 
that O 
have O 
been O 
over O 
the O 
last O 
few O 
weeks. O 
Of O 
course O 
this O 
is O 
the O 
home O 
of O 
the O 
anti- O 
war O 
demonstrations O 
stemming O 
back O 
to O 
the O 
Vietnam O 
War O 
but O 
there O 
are O 
close O 
to O 
between O 
500 O 
and O 
1,000 O 
people. O 
I'm O 
getting O 
various O 
estimates O 
on O 
the O 
crowd. O 
We O 
did O 
want O 
to O 
show O 
you O 
an O 
interesting O 
thing O 
here. O 
Some O 
folks O 
are O 
showing O 
some O 
solidarity O 
with O 
the O 
speakers O 
here. O 
You're O 
looking O 
at O 
some O 
of O 
San O 
Francisco's O 
police O 
department's O 
officers. O 
I O 
did O 
ask O 
them O 
why O 
they O 
did O 
that. O 
They O 
said O 
they O 
were O 
wearing O 
skullcaps O 
so O 
they O 
decided O 
to O 
adopt O 
this O 
to O 
show O 
solidarity. O 
They O 
said O 
the O 
department O 
has O 
not O 
made O 
any O 
statement O 
about O 
whether O 
they O 
think O 
that's O 
all O 
right O 
or O 
not. O 
This O 
has O 
been O 
a O 
very O 
peaceful O 
demonstration. O 
As O 
I O 
said, O 
the O 
officers O 
did O 
tell O 
me O 
that O 
this O 
is O 
the O 
largest O 
pro-troops O 
demonstration O 
that O 
has O 
ever O 
been O 
in O 
San O 
Francisco O 
since O 
the O 
Vietnam O 
War. O 
So O 
far, O 
very O 
peaceful. O 
As O 
I O 
said, O 
there O 
have O 
been O 
a O 
few O 
verbal O 
exchanges O 
but O 
one O 
of O 
the O 
most O

they O

AL-HUSAINI O 
We O

reports O 
that O 
these O 
civilians O 
especially O 
in O 
the O 
(INAUDIBLE) O 
population O 
have O 
been O 
attacked O 
by O 
the O 
Iraqi O 
regime O 
themselves O 
so O 
they O 
can't O 
blame O 
the O 
American O 
and O 
said O 
look O 
what O 
the O 
American O 
doing O 
to O 
us. O 
He O 
would O 
love O 
to O 
see O 
this O

would O 
draw O

you O

your O

well O 
and O 
they O 
also O 
are O 
somewhat O 
suspicious O 
of O 
the O 
Americans. O 
AL-HUSAINI O 
Well, O 
I O 
mean O 
the O 
Iraqi O 
people O 
have O 
been O 
the O 
primary O 
victim O 
from O 
the O 
whole O 
thing. O 
Yeah O 
my O 
family, O 
you O 
know, O 
still O 
in O 
fear. O 
You O 
know O 
they O 
stay O 
in O 
one O

They O 
boarded O 
all O 
the O

all O 
the O

and O 
they O 
built O 
with O 
a O 
brick O 
one O

the O

facing O 
the O

I O 
mean O 
yes, O 
you O 
know, O 
my O 
prayer O 
to O 
them O 
but O 
we O 
can O 
only O 
do O 
so O 
much. O 
Hopefully O 
it O 
will O 
be O 
a O 
short O 
war. O 
It O 
will O 
be O

if O 
I O 
sound O

discomfort. O 
We O 
cannot O 
tell O 
you O 
the O 
levels O 
of O 
personal O 
discomfort O 
we've O 
experienced. O 
The O 
extraordinary O 
sandstorms, O 
the O 
bitter O 
cold O 
nights. O 
The O 
most O 
uncomfortable O 
thing O 
is O 
having O 
to O 
sleep O 
sitting O 
up O

a O

with O 
sandbags O 
under O 
your O 
feet, O 
your O

at O 
your O

That's O 
excruciatingly O 
uncomfortable, O 
not O 
something O 
that O 
you O 
would O 
wish O 
on O 
anybody O 
but O 
a O 
contortionist. O 
Let O 
me O 
give O 
you O

what O 
the O

like. O

close, O 
that O 
is O 
to O

no O 
more O 
than O 
40 O 
yards O 
away, O 
but O 
the O 
dust O

sand O 
are O 
blowing O 
so O 
badly O 
you're O

these O

Well O 
Judy, PER
the O 
Pentagon ORG

beginning O 
to O

positive O 
signs O 
that O 
it O 
hadn't O 
seen O 
for O

happy O 
Iraqi O

U.S. O

that O 
taking O 
place O 
in O 
Najaf. O 
Also O 
the O 
Pentagon ORG
is O 
seeing O 
lighter O 
than O 
expected O 
resistance O 
indicating O 
at O 
least O 
that O 
they O 
may O 
have O 
really O 
seriously O 
degraded O 
those O 
Republican ORG

divisions O 
before O 
the O 
U.S. O 
troops O 
arrived, O 
both O 
in O 
Karbala O 
and O 
also O 
in O 
Al O 
Kut. O 
They O 
met O 
lighter O 
than O 
expected O 
resistance. O 
But O 
the O 
Pentagon ORG
officials O 
stress O 
that O 
as O 
they O 
close O 
in O 
on O 
Baghdad, O 
this O 
becomes O 
the O 
real O 
dangerous O 
part O 
as O 
they O 
enter O 
that O 
so- O 
called O 
red O 
zone O 
where O 
Saddam PER
Hussein PER
is O 
believed O 
to O 
have O 
given O 
his O 
commanders O 
authority O 
to O 
use O 
chemical O 
weapons, O 
and O 
that O 
use O 
of O 
chemical O 
weapons O 
remains O 
a O 
real O 
fear O 
at O

So, O 
in O

we O 
are O 
paying O 
great O 
attention O 
to O 
their O 
ability O

defend O

They O 
may O 
just O 
suddenly O 
be O 
effective O 
on O 
the O

Additionally, O 
their O 
ability O 
to O 
use O 
chemical O 
and O 
biological O 
weapons, O 
they've O 
proven O 
it O 
historically. O 
We O 
believe O 
they O 
have O 
the O 
capability O 
now. O 
Clearly, O 
as O 
we O 
threaten O 
the O 
core O 
of O 
the O

which O 
Baghdad O

we O 
believe O 
that O 
the O 
likelihood O 
of O 
them O

up. O

What O 
do O 
you O 
suppose O 
right O 
now O 
would O 
be O 
the O 
governor O 
on O 
the O 
forward O 
advance? O 
Is O 
it O 
the O 
Republican ORG
Guard ORG
or O 
is O 
it O 
the O 
U.S. O 
and O 
coalition O 
supply O 
lines? O 
Or O 
both? O 
LANG O 
Well, O 
they O 
are O 
close O 
enough O 
up O 
to O 
Baghdad O 
now O 
so O 
that O 
the O 
supply O 
line O 
issue O 
is O 
probably O 
not O 
a O 
big O 
one O 
since O 
they O 
had O 
time O 
to O 
restock, O 
food, O 
fuel O 
and O 
ammunition. O 
So, O 
probably O 
the O 
main O 
thing O 
is O 
combing O 
through O 
the O 
rubble O 
that O 
the O 
air ORG
force ORG
has O 
left O 
of O 
these O 
Republican ORG
Guard ORG
divisions O 
to O 
make O 
sure O 
there O 
are O 
no O 
strong O 
points O 
that O 
you O 
leave O 
behind, O 
that O 
could O 
threaten O 
your O 
lines O 
of O 
supply O 
once O 
they O 
get O 
past. O 
Once O 
they O 
are O 
satisfied O 
they O 
are O 
through O 
all O 
that, O 
I O 
would O 
imaging O 
there O 
will O 
be O 
a O 
pause O 
while O 
they O 
start O 
to O 
reconnoiter O 
into O 
Baghdad, O 
probing O 
hard O 
to O 
see O 
how O 
much O 
resistance O 
there O 
really O 
is. O 
O'BRIEN O 
Well, O 
let O 
me O 
ask O 
you O 
that. O 
First O 
of O 
all, O 
I O 
just O 
wanted O 
to O 
tell O 
viewers O 
where O 
we O 
just O 
took O 
our O 
satellite O 
imagery. O 
This O 
is O 
that O 
Karbala O 
area O 
which O 
is O 
about O 
50 O 
miles O 
from O 
Baghdad. O 
Baghdad O 
is O 
roughly O 
in O 
that O 
direction O 
from O 
there. O 
We O 
know O 
the O 
vanguard O 
is O 
supposedly O 
as O 
close O 
as O 
15 O 
miles. O 
One O 
of O 
the O 
next O 
key O 
points O 
along O 
the O 
way O 
here O 
is O 
Saddam O 
international O 
airport. O 
Do O 
you O 
suppose O 
that O 
is O 
a O 
key O 
target O 
right O 
now? O 
LANG O 
Oh, O 
I'm O 
sure O 
it O 
is. O 
I O 
mean O 
a O 
feature O 
of O 
that O 
importance O 
would O 
always O 
be O 
something O 
you'd O 
want O 
to O 
hold. O 
And O 
besides, O 
as O 
soon O 
as O 
you O 
get O 
control O 
of O 
it O 
you'd O 
be O 
able O 
to O 
start O 
using O 
it O 
for O 
air O 
operations, O 
and O 
put O 
a O 
survey O 
team O 
in O 
there O 
as O 
soon O 
as O 
it's O 
secured, O 
and O 
then O 
start O 
using O 
it O 
for O 
helicopter O 
operations, O 
haul O 
forward O 
some O 
big O 
bladders O 
of O 
fuel O 
to O 
refuel O 
helicopters O 
and O 
rearm O 
them O 
and O 
things O 
like O 
that. O 
And O 
if O 
the O 
front O 
stabilizes O 
between O 
there O 
and O 
the O 
downtown O 
Baghdad, O 
they'll O 
start O 
using O 
it O 
for O 
a O 
fixed O 
wing O 
aircraft O 
as O 
well. O 
O'BRIEN O 
Now, O 
as O 
you O 
go O 
from O 
Saddam O 
International O 
Airport O 
into O 
town O 
you O 
see O 
there O 
are O 
some O 
big, O 
wide O 
divided O 
highways O 
there. O 
Control O 
of O 
these O 
highways O 
will O 
be O 
crucial O 
won't O 
it? O 
LANG O 
Yeah, O 
these O 
are O 
the O 
high-speed O 
approaches O 
into O 
the O 
heart O 
of O 
the O 
city O 
and O 
armored O 
forces O 
like O 
the O 
3rd PER
Mechanized PER
Infantry PER
Division PER
just O 
love O 
high-speed O 
approaches. O 
They O 
will O 
try O 
to O 
go O 
down O 
those O 
things, O 
cutting O 
the O 
city O 
up O 
into O 
sectors O 
as O 
best O 
they O 
can, O 
and O 
then O 
work O 
on O 
the O 
specific O 
sectors O 
of O 
the O 
city O 
they O 
think O 
are O 
a O 
key O 
terrain. O 
I O 
would O 
think, O 
probably, O 
various O 
facilities O 
as O 
well O 
as O 
major O 
government O 
buildings O 
that O 
they O 
need O 
to O 
control O 
to O 
set O 
up O 
a O 
new O 
government. O 
O'BRIEN O 
It's O 
a O 
big O 
city, O 
about O 
the O 
size O 
of O 
Philadelphia O 
or O 
thereabouts. O 
Some O 
have O 
said O 
Chicago O 
is O 
a O 
good O 
analogy. O 
Tremendous O 
amount O 
of O 
force O 
needed O 
to O 
control O 
a O 
city O 
of O 
that O 
source, O 
or O 
am O 
a O 
wrong? O 
LANG O 
Well, O 
it O 
depends O 
on O 
the O 
attitude O 
of O 
the O 
populous, O 
which O 
is O 
not O 
clear O 
yet. O 
If O 
the O 
population, O 
in O 
fact, O 
or O 
at O 
least O 
a O 
big O 
part O 
of O 
them O 
like O 
the O 
Shia PER
half O 
of O 
the O 
population, O 
if O 
they O 
want O 
to O 
be O 
liberated, O 
then O 
you O 
can O 
control O 
them O 
with O 
a O 
fairly O 
small O 
force. O 
If, O 
in O 
fact, O 
a O 
lot O 
of O 
people O 
in O 
the O 
city O 
don't O 
want O 
to O 
be O 
liberated O 
and O 
you're O 
never O 
going O 
to O 
know O 
that O 
until O 
you O 
try, O 
then O 
you're O 
going O 
to O 
need O 
a O 
much O 
larger O 
force, O 
and O 
we O 
might O 
end O 
up O 
waiting O

O'BRIEN O 
Based O 
on O 
what O 
you've O 
seen O 
so O 
far, O 
what O 
is O 
your O 
sense O 
of O 
that? O 
The O 
Shias O 
are O 
a O 
bit O 
gun O 
shy, O 
if O 
you O 
will, O 
in O 
the O 
south O 
because O 
of O 
what O 
happened O 
in O 
1991. O 
They O 
rose O 
up, O 
didn't O 
get O 
American O 
support. O 
Do O 
you O 
suppose O 
it O 
will O 
be O 
a O 
different O 
story O 
in O

Is O 
there O 
a O 
lot O

latent O 
hatred O 
for O 
Saddam PER

that O 
will O 
come O 
out? O 
LANG O 
Yes, O 
there O 
is, O 
but O 
these O 
folks O 
are O 
going O 
to O 
be O 
mighty O 
cautious. O

all O

word O 
from O 
the O 
doctors, O 
and O 
they O 
have O 
successively O 
done O 
one O

There O 
will O 
be O 
other O

she's O

We O

her. O 
D. O 
LYNCH O 
We O 
talked O 
to O 
her O 
before O

surgery, O 
we O 
talked O 
to O 
her O 
after O 
the O 
surgery, O 
and O 
she's O 
doing O 
good. O 
Can't O 
you O 
think? O 
G. O 
LYNCH O 
Yes, O 
a O 
bunch, O 
but O 
my O 
mind's O 
blank. O 
The O 
doctor O 
has O 
completed O 
one O 
surgery O 
on O 
her O 
back. O 
They O 
have O 
released O 
the O 
pressure O 
on O 
a O 
nerve, O 
and O 
realigned O 
all O 
the O 
disks O 
and O 
put O 
plates O 
and O 
stuff O 
in O 
it, O 
and O 
that O 
was O 
because O 
she O 
didn't O 
have O 
any O 
feeling O 
in O 
her O 
feet. O 
So O 
he, O 
he's O 
pretty O 
sure O 
right O 
now O 
that O 
that O 
will O 
relieve, O 
relieve O 
the O 
tension, O 
and O 
her O 
feet O 
will O 
be O 
able O 
to O 
move. O 
Also, O 
we O 
have O 
heard O 
and O 
seen O 
reports O 
that O 
she O 
had O 
multiple O 
gunshot O 
wounds, O 
and O 
knife O 
stabbing. O 
The O 
doctor O 
has O 
not O 
seen O 
any O 
of O 
this. O 
He O 
looked O 
for O 
the O 
gunshot O 
wounds O 
for O 
the O 
knife O

and O 
there O 
is O 
no O

whatsoever. O 
They O 
will O 
do O

again O 
tomorrow O

her O

She O 
has O 
fractured O 
legs O

her O 
right O 
forearm. O

we O 
are O 
just O 
waiting O 
to O

too. O 
D. O 
LYNCH O 
We O 
talked O 
to O 
her O 
before O

after O 
the O 
surgery, O 
like O 
I O 
said, O 
and O 
she's O 
just, O 
she O 
just O 
sounded O 
real O 
good. O 
Of O 
course, O 
this O 
morning O 
she O 
was O 
a O 
little O 
groggy. O 
But O 
yet, O 
she O 
was O 
good, O 
because O 
it O 
was O 
early. O 
And O 
then O 
this O 
afternoon, O 
after O 
the O 
surgery, O 
she O 
was O 
our O 
Jessie PER
again. O 
QUESTION O 
If O 
those O 
weren't O 
gunshot O 
wounds O 
to O 
cause O 
the O 
broken O 
bones, O 
do O 
they O 
know O 
what O 
caused O 
the O 
fractures? O 
G. O 
LYNCH O 
They O 
have O 
no O 
idea O 
at O 
this O 
time O 
what O 
caused O 
them. O 
We O 
know O 
she's O 
in O 
good O 
spirits, O 
because O 
they O 
told O 
her O 
they O 
was O 
gonna O 
put O 
pink O 
casts O 
on O 
her O 
legs O 
and O 
arms, O 
and O 
she O 
had O 
pink O 
casts O 
when O 
she O 
was O 
in O 
the O 
third O 
grade O 
on O 
her O 
arm O 
so O 
we O 
know O 
she O 
-- O 
her O 
mind O 
is O 
working O 
good. O 
So O 
she's O 
in O 
good O 
spirits, O 
and O 
we O 
hope O 
the O 
surgery O 
will O 
go O 
good O 
tomorrow, O 
just O 
as O 
well O 
as O 
it O 
did O 
today. O 
QUESTION O 
Can O 
you O 
tell O 
us O 
what O 
she O 
said O 
to O 
you O 
on O 
the O 
telephone? O 
You O 
said O 
she O 
was O 
in O 
good O 
spirits? O 
Can O 
you O 
describe O 
your O 
conversation? O 
G. O 
LYNCH O 
I O 
teased O 
her O 
again O

the O 
Army ORG

she O 
said, O 
"I O 
know O 
where O 
there's O 
a O 
bunch O 
of O 
that O 
we O 
can O 
find." O

we O

a O

when O

they O 
think O

the O 
problems O 
that O 
can O

Not O

one O 
of O

we O

we O 
have O

her O 
is O 
an O 
armored O 
column O 
with O 
air O 
support O 
coming O

How O 
much O 
jeopardy O 
is O 
a O 
column O 
like O 
this O 
in O 
as O 
it O 
goes O 
through O

LEONHARD O 
It's O 
a O 
great O 
question. O 
I O 
think O 
the O 
animation O 
is O 
good O 
because O 
it O 
does O 
show O 
that O 
you O 
can O 
hide O 
literally O 
anywhere O 
in O 
a O 
city O 
environment, O 
and O 
that O 
is O 
why O 
movement O 
through O 
an O 
urban O 
area O 
is O 
very, O 
very O 
dangerous. O 
It's O 
the O 
side O 
that's O 
moving O 
that's O 
going O 
to O 
take O 
the O 
casualties. O 
That O 
said, O 
the O 
armored O 
fighting O 
vehicles O 
that O 
you O 
see O 
there O 
they O 
look O 
to O 
me O 
as O 
if O 
they're O 
moving O 
a O 
little O 
bit O 
faster O 
as O 
than O 
we O 
probably O 
will. O 
We'll O 
use O 
patience O 
and O 
finesse. O 
We O 
will O 
take O 
the O 
time O 
to O 
locate O 
the O 
enemy, O 
surround O 
the O 
blocks O 
and O 
the O 
buildings O 
that O 
he O 
is O 
in. O 
And O 
then O 
we'll O 
probably O 
surge O 
fires O 
into O 
their O 
both O 
lethal O 
and O 
nonlethal O 
to O 
make O 
his O 
position O 
untenable, O 
to O 
make O 
him O 
move O 
rather O 
than O 
us O 
moving O 
through O 
the O 
assault O 
zone. O 
At O 
which O 
time O 
we O 
can O 
engage O 
them O 
or O 
arrest O 
them. O 
O'BRIEN O 
We'd O 
like O 
to O 
resume O 
with O 
that O 
animation O 
if O 
we O 
could. O 
That's O 
Saddam O 
International O 
Airport. O 
That's O 
another O 
segment. O 
Can O 
we O 
get O 
back O 
to O 
the O 
animation. O 
And O 
I'd O 
like O 
to O 
just O 
finish O 
this O 
out. O 
Here O 
we O 
go. O 
Ad O 
we O 
move O 
it O 
along, O 
you'll O 
see O 
eventually O 
the O 
troops O 
will O 
come O 
marching O 
in. O 
In O 
this O 
case, O 
slightly O 
off O 
target O 
here O 
because O 
you O 
see O 
them O 
all O 
going O 
in O 
the O 
front O 
door. O 
Typically, O 
when O 
they'd O 
assault O 
a O 
target O 
like O 
this, O 
they'd O 
do O 
what? O 
LEONHARD O 
Well, O 
typically, O 
if O 
they O 
do O 
go O 
in, O 
which O 
is O 
generally O 
the O 
option O 
of O 
last O 
resort, O 
but O 
if O 
we O 
do O 
have O 
to O 
go O 
in, O 
often O 
we'll O 
try O 
to O 
go O 
in O 
from O 
the O 
top O 
of O 
the O 
building O 
down. O 
One O 
of O 
the O 
reasons O 
is O 
because O 
we O 
use O 
grenades O 
a O 
lot O 
in O 
clearing O 
buildings, O 
and O 
grenades O 
ten O 
to O 
offend O 
downhill O 
rather O 
than O 
uphill. O 
So, O 
you O 
always O 
want O 
them O 
going O 
down O 
staircases O 
rather O 
than O 
having O 
to O 
try O 
to O 
throw O 
them O 
up O 
the O 
staircase. O

What O 
are O 
we O

Just O 
there, O 
I O

just O

you O 
can O 
see O 
where O 
the O 
weapons O 
have O

go. O 
Now, O 
you O 
just O 
see O 
this O 
soldier O 
right O 
here, O 
he's O 
going O 
to O 
his O 
sidearm O 
to O 
make O 
a O 
little O

his O

he's O

there O

here, O 
which O 
you O 
can't O

the O 
other O 
in O 
this O

right O 
here, O 
and O 
that's O 
always O 
the O 
problem, O 
because O 
as O 
you O 
come O 
in O 
here, O 
you've O 
got O 
to O 
be O 
able O 
to O 
get O 
in O 
there O 
quickly O 
and O 
make O 
sure O 
that O 
this O

here O 
doesn't O 
get O 
shot O 
in O 
the O

O'BRIEN O

what O 
about O 
this, O 
this O

this O 
is O

just O 
for O

will O 
also O 
stop O 
bullets. O 
And O 
there's O 
a O 
difference. O 
The O 
normal O 
flak O 
jacket O 
will O 
stop O 
fragments O 
from O

is O 
a O 
plate O 
that O 
will O 
actually O 
stop O 
and O 
deform O 
a O 
bullet. O 
O'BRIEN O 
All O 
right. O 
Let's O 
roll O 
tape O 
and O 
continue O 
on O 
here O 
and O 
talk O 
about O 
-- O 
Now, O 
I O 
notice O 
his O 
hand O 
-- O 
his O

you O 
can O 
see O 
once O 
that's O

straight O

in O 
case O 
there's O 
any O 
sympathetic O

there's O 
no O

You'll O 
see O 
another O 
person O 
come O 
right O 
up O 
here, O 
and O 
he'll O 
hold O 
on O 
this O 
door, O 
because O 
that's O 
not O 
been O 
cleared O 
space O 
yet, O 
again, O 
straight O 
trigger O 
finger, O 
but O 
ready O

shoot O 
if O

to. O

There O

no O

So O 
those O

it O

where O 
the O 
U.S. O

KUBBA PER
Well, O 
one O 
needs O 
to O 
break O 
down O 
this O 
process O 
into O 
various O 
elements. O 
Today, O 
there O 
should O 
be O 
an O 
authority. O 
And O 
it's O 
very O 
likely O 
that O 
the O 
U.S. O 
and O 
the O 
British O 
forces O 
are O 
the O 
authority O 
on O 
land. O 
And O 
there O 
ought O 
to O 
be O 
administration. O 
And O 
this O 
ought O 
to O 
be O 
primarily O 
by O 
Iraqis. O 
But O 
when O 
it O 
comes O 
to O 
government, O 
I O 
think O 
we O 
really O 
need O 
to O 
map O 
out O 
step O 
by O 
step O 
how O 
to O 
move O 
from O 
this O 
power O 
vacuum O 
to O 
the O 
day O 
we O 
have O 
elections. O

we O 
need O 
to O 
do O 
it O 
quickly, O 
because O 
every O 
day O 
passes O 
by O

this O

trouble. O

one O

going O

I O

it's O 
one O 
thing O 
to O

It's O 
totally O 
another O 
to O 
gain O 
legitimacy O

functioning O

I O

plans O

It O

there O

22 O

there. O 
It's O 
not O 
a O

It's O 
not O

Donald PER

(BEGIN O 
VIDEOTAPE) O 
BLITZER O 
I O 
know O 
during O 
the O 
war, O 
before O 
the O 
war, O 
you O 
were O 
very O 
concerned O 
about O 
the O 
position O 
of O 
the O 
Syrian O 
government, O 
cooperating O 
with O 
Iraqis, O 
having O 
an O 
open O 
border, O 
if O 
you O 
will. O 
Has O 
the O 
situation O 
improved, O 
especially O 
in O 
the O 
aftermath O 
now O 
of O 
the O 
secretary O 
of O 
state's O 
meeting O 
with O 
Bashar PER
al-Asad? PER
RUMSFELD O 
Well, O 
I O 
guess O 
time O 
will O 
tell. O 
I O 
talked O 
to O 
Secretary O 
Powell PER
this O 
morning O 
on O 
the O 
phone O 
a O 
bit, O 
and O 
it's O 
not, O 
I O 
think O 
you O 
need O 
to O 
let O 
the O 
dust O 
settle O 
on O 
that. O 
He's, O 
in O 
my O 
judgment, O 
had O 
a O 
visit O 
that O 
was O 
worth O 
doing, O 
and O 
the O 
president O 
asked O 
him O 
to O 
do O 
it, O 
and O 
it O 
was O 
the O 
right O 
thing O 
to O 
do. O 
We'll O 
see O 
what O 
progress O 
comes. O 
You O 
know, O 
words O 
are O 
one O 
thing, O 
actions O 
are O 
another. O 
BLITZER O 
But O 
right O 
now O 
you're O 
open-minded O 
as O 
far O 
as O 
Syria O 
on O 
whether O 
they O 
will O 
crack O 
down O 
on O 
terrorism, O 
take O 
some O 
of O 
the O 
other O 
steps O 
that O 
you O 
want O 
them O 
to O 
take? O 
RUMSFELD O 
I O 
know O 
what O 
they've O 
been O 
doing, O 
and O 
it's O 
been O 
unhelpful. O 
I O 
know O 
that O 
Secretary O 
Powell PER
was O 
just O 
there O 
and O 
advised O 
them O 
that O 
it O 
was O 
unhelpful, O 
and O 
gave O 
them O 
some O 
pointers O 
and O 
some O 
suggestions O 
for O 
the O 
future. O 
In O 
my O 
view, O 
they O 
were O 
making O 
some O 
unwise O 
decisions O 
previously. O 
What O 
they'll O 
do O 
after O 
this O 
visit O 
remains O 
to O 
be O 
seen. O 
BLITZER O 
The O 
secretary O 
of O 
state O 
has O 
written O 
you O 
a O 
letter O 
expressing, O 
apparently, O 
some O 
concern O 
about O 
the O 
length O 
that O 
the O 
prisoners O 
are O 
going O 
to O 
be O 
spending, O 
those O 
detained O 
at O 
the O 
U.S. O 
Naval O 
base O 
at O 
Guantanamo LOC
Bay LOC
in O 
Cuba, O 
about O 
600 O 
or O 
so O 
of O 
them. O 
Is O 
there O 
any O 
movement O 
in O 
trying O 
to O 
determine O 
the O 
fate O 
of O 
these O 
individuals? O 
RUMSFELD O 
I O 
don't O 
think O 
that's O 
quite O 
accurate O 
as O 
to O 
what O 
he O 
wrote O 
me O 
about. O 
BLITZER O 
All O 
right, O 
tell O 
me O 
what... O 
RUMSFELD O 
I O 
think O 
what O 
he O 
wrote O 
me O 
about O 
was O 
the O 
fact O 
that O 
the O 
inter-agency O 
process, O 
where O 
we O 
have O 
all O 
these O 
FBI ORG
and O 
Department ORG
of O 
Justice O 
and O 
CIA ORG
and O 
DIA, ORG
and O 
what O 
have O 
you, O 
involved O 
in O 
interrogating O 
these O 
detainees, O 
it O 
takes O 
time O 
to O 
find O 
out O 
what O 
intelligence O 
they O 
have. O 
It O 
also O 
takes O 
time O 
to O 
figure O 
out O 
what O 
law O 
enforcement O 
process O 
might O 
be O 
appropriate, O 
and O 
what O 
Colin PER
and O 
I O 
have O 
been O 
concerned O 
about, O 
both O 
of O 
us, O 
is O 
that O 
it's O 
taking O 
so O 
long. O 
There O 
are O 
a O 
number O 
of O 
countries, O 
and O 
the O 
Department ORG
of ORG
State ORG
has O 
the O 
responsibility O 
of O 
dealing O 
with O 
those O 
countries, O 
that O 
have O 
foreign O 
nationals O 
in O 
Gitmo, LOC
in O 
Guantanamo LOC
Bay, LOC
Cuba, O 
being O 
detained, O 
and O 
those O 
countries, O 
understandably, O 
would O 
like O 
to O 
know O 
when O 
they O 
could O 
have O 
those O 
people.So O 
the O 
inter-agency O 
process O 
takes O 
a O 
great O 
deal O 
of O 
time. O 
Colin PER
and O 
I O 
are O 
trying O 
to O 
speed O 
up O 
that O 
process, O 
and O 
that's O 
what O 
that's O 
all O 
about. O 
BLITZER O 
Let O 
me O 
just, O 
a O 
couple O 
of O 
nuggets O 
to O 
sort O 
of O 
wrap O 
up O 
before O 
I O 
let O 
you O 
go. O 
Victory O 
parades O 
for O 
the O 
troops. O 
I O 
remember O 
covering O 
General O 
Schwarzkopf, PER
the O 
parades O 
in O 
Washington O 
and O 
New O 
York O 
after O 
the O 
first O 
Gulf LOC
War. O 
Do O 
you O 
want O 
the O 
troops O 
to O 
be O 
honored O 
in O 
that O 
way O 
when O 
they O 
come O 
back, O 
to O 
have O 
parades O 
in O 
New O 
York, O 
Washington, O 
elsewhere? O 
RUMSFELD O 
There's O 
no O 
question O 
but O 
that O 
the O 
troops, O 
the O 
young O 
men O 
and O 
women, O 
did O 
such O 
a O 
superb O 
job O 
that O 
there O 
has O 
to O 
be O 
a O 
way O 
to O 
honor O 
them, O 
and O 
there O 
will O 
be. O 
And O 
General O 
Franks PER
and O 
his O 
team O 
have O 
done O 
just O 
a O 
superb O 
job O 
for O 
our O 
country O 
and O 
for O 
the O 
world, O 
and O 
indeed O 
for O 
the O 
Iraqi O 
people, O 
who O 
have O 
been O 
liberated. O 
What's O 
the O 
best O 
way O 
to O 
do O 
that? O 
In O 
the O 
case O 
of O 
1991, O 
the O 
task O 
was O 
to O 
go O 
in O 
and O 
get O 
them O 
out O 
of O 
Kuwait, O 
and O 
they O 
did O 
it, O 
and O 
they O 
were O 
properly O 
greeted O 
coming O 
back O 
to O 
the O 
United O 
States. O 
In O 
this O 
instance, O 
it O 
was O 
a O 
very O 
different O 
task. O 
It O 
was O 
to O 
remove O 
that O 
regime, O 
and O 
it's O 
part O 
of O 
a O 
global O 
war O 
on O 
terrorism O 
that O 
is O 
not O 
over. O 
We O 
still O 
have O 
to O 
face O 
the O 
problem O 
of O 
a O 
number O 
of O 
global O 
terrorist O 
networks O 
and O 
terrorist O 
states O 
that O 
exist, O 
that O 
work O 
with O 
those O 
global O 
networks. O 
And O 
on O 
the O 
one O 
hand O 
we O 
will, O 
in O 
fact, O 
find O 
a O 
way O 
to O 
honor O 
the O 
courage O 
and O 
dedication O 
and O 
talent O 
of O 
these O 
young O 
men O 
and O 
women, O 
and O 
we'll O 
do O 
it O 
well. O 
Whether O 
it O 
will O 
be O 
modeled O 
off O 
the O 
1991 O 
thing, O 
I O 
don't O 
know. O 
I O 
kind O 
of O 
doubt O 
it, O 
because O 
it's O 
such O 
a O 
different O 
circumstance. O 
Certainly, O 
our O 
war O 
plan O 
was O 
not O 
modeled O 
off O 
of O 
1991. O 
BLITZER O 
One O 
final O 
question O 
on O 
North O 
Korea. O 
If O 
the O 
North O 
Koreans O 
pursue O 
their O 
nuclear O 
weapons O 
ambitions... O 
RUMSFELD O 
Yes. O 
BLITZER O 
... O 
a O 
preemptive O 
strike, O 
is O 
that O 
something O 
that O 
is O 
out O 
there? O 
RUMSFELD O 
I'm O 
not O 
one O 
who O 
speculates O 
about O 
things O 
like O 
that. O 
I O 
know O 
that O 
back O 
in O 
the O 
1990s, O 
in O 
the O 
Clinton PER
administration, O 
Secretary O 
Perry PER
called O 
in O 
the O 
former O 
secretaries O 
of O 
defense, O 
and O 
we O 
had O 
a O 
discussion, O 
and O 
they O 
clearly O 
had O 
teed O 
up O 
a O 
military O 
option O 
that O 
they O 
were O 
considering, O 
and O 
they O 
then O 
at O 
a O 
certain O 
moment O 
were O 
able O 
to O 
do O 
some O 
things O 
that O 
persuaded O 
them O 
that O 
that O 
was O 
not O 
appropriate. O 
But O 
those O 
are O 
very O 
serious O 
issues, O

leave O

that, O 
I O

have O 
to O 
be O 
working O 
with O 
these O 
people O 
who O 
are O 
in O 
the O

make O 
sure O

What O 
about O 
you, O 
Senator O

do O 
you O 
believe, O 
in O

SEN. O 
CHRISTOPHER O 
DODD O 
(D), O 
CONNECTICUT O 
I O 
have O 
no O 
evidence O 
to O 
the O 
contrary. O 
And O 
certainly, O 
they O 
have O 
used O 
them O 
in O 
the O 
past. O 
There's O 
no O 
doubt O 
about O 
that O 
at O 
all, O 
both O 
in O 
Iran O 
and O 
against O 
the O 
Kurdish PER
population. O 
So, O 
whether O 
or O 
not O 
they O 
find O 
them O 
in O 
the O 
exact O 
form O 
that O 
many O 
would O 
assume O 
they O 
would O 
be O 
the O 
case O 
-- O 
possibly O 
some O 
got O 
out O 
of O 
the O 
country. O 
It O 
wouldn't O 
surprise O 
me O 
to O 
hear O 
that. O 
But O 
I'm O 
going O 
to O 
work O 
on O 
the O 
assumption, O 
based O 
on O 
the O 
intelligence O 
that O 
has O 
been O 
gathered, O 
that O 
the O 
weapons O 
of O 
mass O 
destruction O 
existed. O 
BLITZER O 
What O 
if O 
they O 
don't? O 
DODD O 
Well, O 
you O 
know, O 
they've O 
used O 
it O 
in O 
the O 
past, O 
and O 
I O 
think O 
the O 
point O 
that O 
Senator O 
Lugar PER
just O 
made O 
-- O 
certainly O 
having O 
the O 
intellectual O 
capacity O 
to O 
do O 
this O 
was O 
proven O 
already O 
by O 
the O 
fact O 
they've O 
used O 
them O 
in O 
the O 
past. O 
So, O 
I O 
wouldn't O 
dwell O 
on O 
that O 
point O 
specifically, O 
because O 
Saddam PER
Hussein PER
clearly O 
was O 
a O 
producer O 
and O 
a O 
user O 
of O 
biological O 
and O 
chemical O 
weapons. O 
He O 
clearly O 
was O 
on O 
the O 
track O 
to O 
acquire O 
a O 
nuclear O 
capacity, O 
and O 
the O 
world O 
is O 
a O 
safer O 
place O 
today O 
because O 
he's O 
not O 
ruling O 
Iraq. O 
BLITZER O 
Will O 
the O 
U.S. O

creditability, O 
Mr. O

if, O 
if O 
the O 
U.S. O 
finds O 
no O 
hard O 
evidence, O 
no O 
so-called O 
smoking O 
gun? O 
LUGAR O 
No, O 
we O 
have O 
full O 
credibility O 
in O 
Iraq. O 
We've O 
prosecuted O 
with O 
the O

a O 
successful O 
liberation O 
of O 
the O 
Iraqi O 
people, O 
and O 
we O 
have O 
clearly O 
caused O 
Saddam PER
to O 
destroy O 
weapons O 
of O 
mass O 
destruction, O 
or O 
at O 
least O 
to O 
suppress O 
evidence O 
of O 
them. O 
That O 
is O 
a O 
victory O 
of O 
sorts.This O 
is O 
a O 
facet O 
that's O 
important. O 
It's O 
important O 
in O 
the O 
war O 
against O 
terrorism O 
that O 
we O 
rout O 
out O 
whatever O 
is O 
there O 
and, O 
likewise, O 
the O 
people O 
involved, O 
because O 
they O 
might O 
help O 
supply O 
al ORG

other O

BLITZER O 
Senator O

how O 
important O 
is O 
it O 
for O 
the O 
U.S. O 
to O 
conclusively O 
learn O 
what O 
happened O 
to O 
Saddam PER
Hussein? PER
DODD O 
Well, O 
it's O 
important. O 
But O 
I O 
don't O 
think O 
it's O 
as O 
important O 
as O 
finding O 
Osama PER
bin PER
Laden, PER
for O 
the O 
simple O 
reason O 
that O 
I O 
don't O 
think O 
Saddam PER
Hussein PER
today O 
poses O 
any O 
threat, O 
wherever O 
he O 
is. O 
If O 
he O 
is O 
alive, O 
obviously, O 
he O 
doesn't O 
pose O 
the O 
kind O 
of O 
threat O 
that O 
an O 
Osama O 
bin O 
Laden O 
does O 
with O 
his O 
cellular O 
network O 
around O 
the O 
world O 
to O 
reactivate O 
al ORG

and O 
international O 
terrorism. O 
So, O 
it O 
would O 
certainly O 
be O 
good O 
to O 
know O 
where O 
he O 
is. O 
It O 
would O 
be, O 
certainly, O 
to O 
know, O 
to O 
apprehend O 
him, O 
to O 
bring O 
him O 
before O 
a O 
court O 
of O 
justice. O 
But O 
I O 
don't O 
think O 
it's O 
absolutely O 
critical O 
for O 
the O 
ultimate O 
success O 
of O 
this O

anticipate O 
large O 
numbers O

will O 
remain O

LUGAR O 
Well, O 
I O 
was O 
heartened O 
by O 
what O 
Secretary O

told O 
you O 
in O 
the O 
last O

that O 
we O 
will O 
have O 
troops O 
there O 
as O 
long O 
as O 
necessary, O 
but O 
no O 
longer O 
than O 
necessary. O 
I O 
think O 
that's O 
a O 
pretty O 
good O 
way O 
to O 
state O 
it. O 
My O 
own O 
view O 
is O 
that O 
the O 
security O 
of O 
the O 
country O 
clearly O 
is O 
our O 
responsibility O 
presently. O 
We O 
are O 
trying O 
to O 
pass O 
that O 
on O 
to O 
others. O 
Likewise, O 
the O 
other O 
government's O 
procedures, O 
the O 
fledgling O 
beginnings O 
on O 
democracy, O 
and O 
all O 
the O 
rest. O 
But O 
that's O 
going O 
to O 
require O 
an O 
undergirding. O 
Now, O 
in O 
due O 
course, O 
as O 
everybody O 
points O 
out, O 
we O 
may O 
get O 
help O 
from O 
other O 
countries. O 
We O 
may O 
bring O 
in O 
NATO ORG
allies O 
or O 
the O 
United ORG
Nations ORG
or O 
other O 
people O 
in O 
the O 
Arab PER
world. O 
That O 
would O 
be O 
helpful. O 
But O 
for O 
the O 
moment, O 
this O 
is O 
our O 
responsibility. O 
And O 
we O 
ought O 
not O 
to O 
be O 
having O 
large O 
debates O 
about O 
how O 
rapidly O 
we O 
move O 
out. O 
And O 
I O 
was O 
upset, O 
in O 
a O 
way, O 
to O 
hear O 
reports O 
that O 
by O 
the O 
fall, O 
three O 
divisions O 
out O 
of O 
five O 
would O 
be O 
gone. O 
I O 
think O 
Secretary O 
Rumsfeld PER
disabused O 
us O 
of O 
that O 
today. O 
BLITZER O 
And O 
what O 
about O 
you, O 
Senator O 
Dodd, PER
not O 
only O 
the O 
length O 
of O 
time, O 
but O 
the O 
cost O 
to O 
U.S. O 
taxpayers? O 
Have O 
you O 
been O 
given O 
any O 
ballpark O 
estimate O 
what O 
this O 
is O 
going O 
to O 
cost O 
the O 
United O 
States? O 
DODD O 
No. O 
Well, O 
what O 
we've O 
heard O 
the O 
numbers O 
of O 
reconstruction O 
running O 
around O 
$100 O 
billion. O 
We O 
put O 
$2.5 O 
billion O 
in, O 
in O 
the O 
last O 
supplemental O 
appropriations O 
bill. O 
So O 
it's O 
going O 
to O 
be O 
costly. O 
These O 
RFPs, O 
these O 
seeking O 
bids O 
on O 
various O 
contracts O 
are O 
rather O 
costly, O 
and O 
so O 
it's O 
going O 
to O 
be O 
expensive. O 
And O 
clearly O 
the O 
responsibility O 
is O 
going O 
to O 
fall O 
principally O 
on O 
the O 
United O 
States. O 
Now, O 
I O 
would O 
hope O 
that O 
sooner O 
rather O 
than O 
later O 
we O 
could O 
see O 
a O 
civilian O 
government O 
emerge O 
in O 
Iraq, O 
a O 
democratically O 
elected O 
one, O 
that O 
there'd O 
be O 
more O 
cooperation O 
from O 
the O 
international O 
community, O 
on O 
both O 
the O 
peacekeeping O 
side O 
as O 
well O 
as O 
the O 
political O 
restructuring O 
that's O 
necessary O 
in O 
Iraq. O 
And O 
to O 
the O 
extent O 
we O 
can O 
move O 
that O 
along O 
more O 
quickly, O 
I O

we're O 
all O 
going O 
to O

better O 
off. O

almost O 
the O

seize O 
a O 
bridge, O 
a O 
bridge O 
that O 
might O 
be O 
defended O 
by O 
iraqis. O 
let's O 
look O 
at O 
the O 
animation. O 
typical O 
scenario O 
there. O 
it O 
doesn't O 
really O 
matter O 
for O 
this O 
scenario O 
that O 
we're O 
laying O 
out O 
here. O 
this O 
would O 
be O 
representing O 
m1-a1 O 
tanks O 
coming O 
towards O 
the O 
bridge O 
firing. O 
you O 
have O 
to O 
bundle O 
up O 
and O 
line O 
up O 
to O 
go O 
across O 
that O 
bridge. O 
makes O 
it O 
vulnerable O 
to O 
fire O 
from O 
the O 
other O 
side. O 
potentially O 
chemical O 
weapons, O 
too. O 
as O 
we O 
turn O 
the O 
other O 
direction, O 
what O 
you'll O 
see O 
are O 
these O 
iraqi O 
tanks O 
that O 
are O 
kind O 
of O 
fortified O 
there. O 
they O 
have O 
burns O 
in O 
front O 
of O 
them. O 
artillery O 
behind O 
them O 
firing O 
back. O 
and O 
then O 
they O 
there O 
goes O 
the O 
smoke O 
screen. O 
the O 
idea O 
of O 
the O 
smoke O 
screen O 
is O 
to O 
obscure O 
the O 
oncoming O 
forces O 
fire O 
ing O

you O 
from O 
being O 
able O 
to O 
see. O 
it O 
doesn't O 
work, O 
though. O 
it O 
works O 
both O 
ways. O 
it O 
obscures O 
you O 
but O 
also O 
obscures O 
them. O 
here's O 
an O

over O

i O 
very O 
clear O

increasingly O 
clear O 
intelligence O

to O 
what O 
the O 
final O

what O 
they're O 
doing O

going O 
in O 
now, O 
very O 
carefully, O 
obviously O 
some O 
symbolic O 
raids O

the O 
more O

they're O

fanatically O

intelligence O

so O 
crucial O

is O 
saying O 
is O 
a O 
stage O

anarchy O

parts O

do O 
you O 
think O 
the O 
administration O 
underestimated O 
the O 
day O 
after? O 
i O 
think O 
because O 
the O 
day O 
after O 
came O 
so O 
fast O 
and O 
so O 
suddenly O 
in O 
way. O 
i O 
think O 
that O 
there's O 
been O 
a O 
pattern O 
here O 
not O 
just O 
with O 
this O 
administration, O 
but O 
over O 
the O 
last O 
ten O 
years, O 
bosnia, O 
kosovo, O 
afghanistan, O 
where O 
we O 
don't O 
quite O 
recognize O 
when O 
the O 
old O 
order O 
collapses, O 
you O 
very O 
quickly O 
have O 
to O 
rush O 
in O 
and O 
fill O 
it O 
with O 
some O 
kind O 
of O 
new O 
order. O 
in O 
the O 
short-term, O 
that's O 
going O 
to O 
have O 
to O 
mean O 
the O 
american O 
military. O 
but O 
the O 
key O 
question, O 
which O 
i O 
try O 
to O 
address O 
in O 
the O 
book, O 
is O 
what O 
do O 
you O 
do O 
after O 
that? O 
what O 
kind O 
of O 
authority O 
do O 
you O 
create O 
in O 
a O 
society O 
going O 
through O 
this O 
kind O 
of O 
transition. O 
and O 
how O 
do O 
you O 
know O 
that O 
the O 
local O 
iraqi O 
citizens O 
will O 
make O 
up O 
this O 
government O 
or, O 
in O 
fact, O 
interested O 
in O 
democracy? O 
there's O 
no O 
proof O 
of O 
that. O 
well, O 
the O 
key O 
here O 
is O 
the O 
only O 
way O 
to O 
get O 
that O 
kind O 
of O 
legitimate O 
government O 
to O 
have O 
it O 
look O 
good O 
is O 
to O 
hold O 
elections. O 
but O 
if O 
you O 
hold O 
elections, O 
you O 
stop O 
the O 
whole O 
process O 
of O 
building O 
a O 
rule O 
of O 
law, O 
creating O 
courts, O 
creating O 
administration. O 
we've O 
seen O 
in O 
the O 
past O 
in O 
bosnia O 
for O 
example, O 
you O 
held O 
elections O 
and O 
all O 
of O 
the O 
old O 
ethnic O 
thugs O 
get O 
into O 
power O 
because O 
they O 
have O 
organization O 
and O 
they O 
have O 
money O 
and O 
they O 
stop O 
the O 
process O 
of O 
genuine O 
building O 
of O 
democracy. O 
there O 
is O 
this O 
tension O 
here O 
which O 
is O 
the O 
only O 
way O 
to O 
make O 
this O 
look O 
good O 
is O 
in O 
some O 
way O 
get O 
legitimate O

the O 
faster O 
you O 
get O 
that, O 
the O 
more O 
likely O 
you O 
stop O 
this O 
process. O 
so O 
what O 
do O 
you O

interim O

you O

most O 
small O

are O 
sole O

some O

a O

also O 
needs O

our O

and O 
yet O 
another O 
reason O 
why O 
that O

could O 
be O 
a O 
key O

there O 
are O

this O 
person O

going O 
to O 
come O

look O 
at O 
the O 
body. O

that O 
by O

a O

he O

the O

all O 
that O

was O 
essentially O 
nonsensical O 
because O 
in O 
1990, O 
saddam PER
hussein PER
made O 
the O 
only O 
self O 
criticism. O 
he O 
said, O 
i O 
could O 
either O

kuwait O

finish O

the O 
nuclear O 
weapon. O 
maybe O 
before O 
the O

then O 
later O 
he O

oh, O 
i O 
should O 
have O 
got O 
the O 
nuclear O 
weapon O 
before O 
i O 
invaded. O 
he O 
was O 
right O 
about O 
that. O 
but O 
that O 
means O 
that O 
he O 
inaugurated O 
at O 
that O 
point O 
like O 
a O 
dozen-year's O 
war O 
where O 
the O

criticized O

doing O 
too O 
little O

acting O 
too O

all O 
we're O

to O 
do O 
with O

that O

the O

the O

didn't O

she O

quite O 
a O 
misfit O 
for O 
this O

she O 
showed O 
that O 
over O

she O

not O 
good O 
at O 
all O 
at O

the O

message O 
to O 
the O 
public O

certainly O 
to O 
the O 
environmental O

she O 
was O 
even O 
worse O 
at O 
bringing O 
the O 
epa ORG
bureaucracy, O 
the O 
epa ORG
environmental O 
policy O 
makers' O 
message O 
to O 
this O 
administration O 
because O 
she O 
saw O 
herself O 
undercut O 
over O 
and O 
over. O 
that's O 
interesting O 
because O 
leading O 
into O 
it, O 
while O 
she O 
was O 
new O 
jersey O 
governor, O 
she O 
sued O 
the O

she O 
was O 
very O 
much O 
considering O 
herself O 
to O

then O 
only O 
to O 
end O 
up O 
becoming O 
the O

then O 
of O

there O 
was O 
a O

what O

you O

perhaps O 
she O

out O

i'm O 
sure O 
that O 
it O

everybody O

the O

tread O 
water O

do O 
the O 
dead O 
man O 
float O 
and O 
they O 
have O 
to O 
pass O 
that O 
in O 
order O 
to O 
continue O

also O 
drills O 
take O

get O

before O 
any O

they O 
also O 
have O 
a O 
manual O 
device O 
so O 
if O 
the O 
toggles O 
don't O 
work O 
they O 
can O 
blow O 
air O

the O 
inflation O

such O

some O

they O

entire O 
ship. O 
there O 
is O 
a O 
man O 
overboard O 
so O 
everyone O 
knows O 
they O 
have O 
to O 
react O 
quickly. O 
a O 
ship-wide O 
search O 
will O 
happen O 
f. O 
they O 
don't O 
see O 
that O 
person O 
go O 
overboard, O 
but O 
if O 
indeed O 
they O 
do O 
see O 
someone O 
go O 
overboard, O 
the O 
ship O 
starts O 
to O 
circle O 
that O 
area O 
continuously. O 
also O 
small O 
boats O 
sometimes O 
go O 
out O 
into O 
the O 
water, O 
but O 
even O 
more O 
importantly, O 
helicopters O 
are O 
launched O 
immediately. O 
inside O 
those O 
helicopters O 
rescue O 
imswimmers. O 
if O 
indeed O 
the O 
man O 
overboard O 
is O 
located, O 
well O 
the O 
hoister O 
is O 
dropped O 
down O 
with O 
usually O 
a O 
torso O 
harness. O 
if O 
the O 
man O 
overboard O 
is O 
injured O 
then O 
they O 
may O 
use O 
a O 
basket, O 
but O 
more O 
than O 
likely O 
those O 
swimmers O 
will O 
go O 
right O 
into O 
the O 
water O 
and O 
try O 
and O 
help O 
the O 
swimmer O 
hook O 
up O 
on O 
that O 
harness O 
and O 
pull O 
them O 
up O 
into O 
the O 
helo O 
and O 
pull O 
them O 
back O 
on O 
to O 
the O 
ship O 
for O 
treatment O 
and O 
usually O 
a O 
search O 
takes O 
about O 
24 O 
hours. O 
the O 
search O 
crews O 
will O 
go O 
24 O 
hours O 
before O 
calling O 
off O 
that O 
search. O 
why O 
call O 
it O 
off? O 
there's O 
a O 
number O 
of O 
reasons O 
to O 
look O 
at. O 
depending O 
on O 
the O 
water O 
temperature, O 
it's O 
very O 
possible O 
that O 
or O 
very O 
common O 
in O 
cold O 
water O 
that O 
someone O 
will O 
not O 
survive O 
a O 
certain O 
amount O 
of O 
time. O 
also O 
the O 
reason O 
for O 
the O 
24-hour O 
search O 
is O 
they O 
fail O 
they've O 
exhausted O 
all O 
resources O 
by O 
that O 
time. O 
anyway, O 
we'll O 
continue O

follow O 
what's O

no, O

we O 
-- O 
we O 
were O 
100% O 
sure O 
we O 
could O 
make O 
it, O 
absolutely. O 
because O 
we O 
came O 
very O 
close O 
to O 
the O

we O 
had O 
our O 
rescue O

i O

it. O 
i O 
saw O 
the O 
fishermen O 
also O 
had O 
the O 
surviving O

that O

you, O

thank O 
you. O 
it O 
was O 
only O 
about O 
30 O 
years O 
ago O 
when O 
we O 
went O 
to O 
the O 
moon. O 
so O 
what's O 
the O 
difficulty O 
in O 
being O 
able O 
to O 
go O 
to O 
mars? LOC
it's O 
unimaginably O 
difficult O 
and O 
different. O 
mars LOC
is O 
at O 
most O 
times O 
100 O 
million O 
miles O 
away O 
from O 
us. O 
it's O 
a O 
nine-month O 
trip. O 
then O 
if O 
we O 
stay O 
there O 
for O 
about O 
a O 
year O 
or O 
two, O 
the O 
whole O 
trip O 
could O 
last O 
about O 
three O 
years. O 
we're O 
talking O 
about O 
conditions O 
where O 
there's O 
radiation O 
in O 
space O 
cosmic O 
radiation O 
that O 
could O 
cause O 
cancer. O 
the O 
communications O 
conditions O 
once O 
you're O 
on O 
mars, LOC
just O 
to O 
talk O 
to O 
people O 
on O 
earth, LOC
there's O 
a O 
20 O 
minute O 
delay O 
in O 
the O 
conversation. O 
so O 
the O 
-- O 
you O 
know, O 
the O 
issues O 
are O 
so O 
much O 
larger O 
than O 
going O 
to O 
the O 
moon. O 
and O 
for O 
now, O 
it's O 
250 O 
days, O 
which O 
seems O 
to O 
be O 
the O 
maximum O 
for O 
astronauts O 
in O 
space O 
anyway. O 
but O 
as O 
you O 
say, O 
it's O 
a O 
much O 
further O 
travel. O 
but O 
let's O 
talk O 
about O 
some O 
of O 
the O 
hurdles O 
that O 
hamper O 
humans O 
to O 
be O 
able O 
to O 
survive O 
there. O 
the O 
dust, O 
for O 
one O 
thing. O 
cataracts O 
another. O 
let's O 
talk O 
about O 
the O 
right O 
kind O 
of O 
spacecraft O 
that O 
would O 
be O 
able O 
to O 
allow O 
humans O 
to O 
actually O 
get O 
that O 
far O 
and O 
to O 
survive. O 
right. O 
well, O 
first O 
of O 
all, O 
the O 
spacecraft O 
would O 
not O 
be O 
launched O 
from O 
earth. LOC
you'd O 
have O 
to O 
launch O 
is O 
from O 
in O 
space O 
already, O 
which O 
means O 
we O 
would O 
have O 
to O 
build O 
it O 
in O 
space. O 
so O 
that O 
means O 
we O 
need O 
a O 
good O 
shuttle O 
that's O 
going O 
to O 
take O 
us O 
back O 
and O 
forth O 
to O 
build O 
the O 
spacecraft. O 
then O 
we O 
have O 
to O 
come O 
up O 
with O 
the O 
fuel O 
that O 
will O 
take O 
it O 
out O 
of O 
the O 
earth's LOC
orbit O 
all O 
the O 
way O 
to O 
mars. LOC
that's O 
probably O 
going O 
to O 
be O 
nuclear O 
propulsion O 
at O 
this O 
point O 
again O 
something O 
we O 
haven't O 
really O 
developed O 
yet, O 
because O 
we O 
couldn't O 
carry O 
that O 
much O 
fuel, O 
obviously. O 
liquid O 
oxygen O 
would O 
be O 
way O 
too O 
heavy O 
to O 
carry O 
all O 
the O 
way O 
to O 
mars. LOC
the O 
bigger O 
issue O 
is O 
once O 
we O 
get O 
there, O 
we O 
can't O 
carry O 
oxygen O 
or O 
water O 
or O 
food O 
to O 
stay O 
there O 
three O 
years, O 
so O 
we're O 
going O 
to O 
have O 
to O 
do O 
all O 
of O 
that O 
on O 
the O 
surface O 
of O 
the O 
planet. O 
and O 
think O 
of O 
it. O 
mars LOC
is O 
carbon O 
dioxide. O 
so O 
we O 
can't O 
breathe O 
there. O 
so O 
we're O 
going O 
to O 
have O 
to O 
come O 
up O 
with O 
some O 
conversion O 
technique O 
to O 
create O 
water, O 
to O 
create O 
oxygen O 
and O 
then O 
some O 
way O 
of O 
growing O 
food O 
on O 
the O 
planet O 
itself. O 
all O 
of O 
this O 
is O 
in O 
the O 
works O 
now, O 
but O 
i O 
think O 
it's O 
going O 
to O 
take O 
quite O 
a O 
few O 
years O 
to O 
develop O 
it. O 
you O 
talk O 
about O 
the O 
cosmic O 
radiation. O 
then O 
of O 
course O 
there O 
is O 
the O 
zero O 
g O 
bone O 
loss, O 
almost O 
like O 
the O 
eroding O 
of O 
bone O 
to O 
humans O 
that O 
would O 
be O 
at O 
risk O 
as O 
well. O 
absolutely. O 
there O 
could O 
be O 
as O 
much O 
as O 
50% O 
bone O 
loss O 
in O 
astronauts O 
in O 
mars. LOC
why? O 
during O 
the O 
time O 
in O 
mars. LOC
because O 
when O 
the O 
body O 
has O 
-- O 
when O 
there O 
is O 
no O 
dpravity O 
as O 
there O 
is O 
on O 
mars, LOC
the O 
body O 
doesn't O 
pick O 
up O 
the O 
calcium O 
in O 
the O 
bones, O 
so O 
it O 
doesn't O 
keep O 
getting O 
the O 
bones O 
stronger O 
and O 
stronger. O 
so O 
they O 
will O 
just O 
lose O 
it. O 
they O 
will O 
be O 
almost O 
like O 
old O 
people O 
even O 
at O 
the O 
age O

40. O

eighty O

south, O 
you'd O 
be O

with O

it's O 
a O

with O 
some O 
office O

you O 
know? O 
B O 
Yeah. O 
It's O 
uh O 
A O 
So. O 
It's O 
kind O 
of O 
like, O 
that's O 
the O 
job O 
that O 
they're O 
t- O 
everyone's O 
trying O 
to O 
stay O

B O

I O

they're O 
quite O

they've O

better. O 
I O 
know O 
the O 
bigger O 
companies O 
have O 
tried O 
to O 
-- O 
stay O 
away O 
from O 
that, O 
cause O 
uh O 
-- O

the O 
that O

Bank ORG

as O

Bill PER
Oh, O 
okay. O 
That's O 
interesting. O 
Alexander PER
And, O 
you O 
know, O 
and O 
I O 
have O 
a O 
company, O 
as O 
well, O 
set O 
up. O 
I O 
think O 
we O 
have O 
the O 
account O 
manager, O 
and O 
we O 
have O 
-- O 
the O 
vice O 
president. O 
We O 
have O 
super- O 
team O 
lead- O 
team O 
leads, O 
uh O 
I O 
and O 
then O 
have O 
operations O 
specialist. O 
We O 
have, O 
you O 
know, O 
I O 
-- O 
team O 
managers, O 
training O 
managers. O 
It's O 
a O 
very O 
big O 
company. O 
Yeah, O 
and O 
I O 
think O 
that O 
the O 
atmosphere O 
is O 
very O 
good, O 
I O 
Bill PER
Right. O 
Alexander PER
Yeah. O 
Bill PER
Well, O 
I O 
think O 
that's O 
important O 
to O 
to O 
have O 
a O 
good O 
atmosphere O 
and O 
also, O 
uh, O 
uh, O 
i- O 
know O 
who O 
who O 
really O 
is O 
in O 
charge, O 
uh, O 
you O 
know, O 
and O 
and O 
know O 
who O 
you O 
have O 
to O 
answer O 
to. O 
Because O 
sometimes, O 
y- O 
I O 
I O 
I O 
did O 
I O 
years O 
ago O 
I O 
had O 
a O 
company O 
that O 
was, O 
uh, O 
it O 
was, O 
uh, O 
I O 
was O 
a O 
subs- O 
s- O 
captive O 
sub-contractor O 
for O 
making O 
packaging O 
material. O 
And, O 
um, O 
there O 
were O 
a O 
lot O 
of O 
salesmen O 
in O 
the O 
company, O 
they O 
had O 
a O 
tendency O 
to, O 
you O 
know, O 
there O 
was O 
there O 
was, O 
uh, O 
a O 
chain O 
of O 
command, O 
you O 
might O 
say. O 
You O 
know, O 
there O 
was, O 
uh, O 
the O 
person O 
that O 
was O 
the, O 
uh, O 
head O 
of O 
the O 
organization. O 
But, O 
all O 
the O 
salesmen O 
-- O 
used O 
to O 
come O 
around O 
and O 
give O 
orders, O 
too, O 
you O 
know. O 
So O 
it O 
made O 
it O 
kind O 
of O 
difficult O 
for O 
the O 
m- O 
for O 
my O 
employees, O 
because O 
they O 
would O 
the O 
salesmen O 
would O 
be O 
coming O 
out, O 
uh, O 
uh, O 
without O 
consulting O 
with O 
the O 
one O 
that O 
was O 
in O 
charge. O 
They O 
would O 
just O 
be O 
coming O 
out O 
and O 
giving O 
orders O 
when O 
they O 
should O 
already O 
went O 
through O 
him. O 
So O 
it O 
made O 
it O 
difficult. O 
So O 
I O 
I O 
I O 
think O 
it's O 
really O 
important O 
to O 
h- O 
have O 
that O 
really O 
clear. O 
That O 
that O 
there's O 
some O 
organized O 
way O 
to O 
deal O 
with, O 
uh, O 
problems O 
and O 
orders O 
and O 
things O 
like O 
that, O 
and O 
if O 
there O 
is O 
a O 
problem, O 
then O 
-- O 
you O 
go O 
to O 
the O 
person O 
who's O 
in O 
charge O 
and O 
-- O 
then O 
they O 
can O 
handle O 
it. O 
So, O 
that O 
was O 
-- O 
that O 
that's O 
just O 
a O 
you O 
know, O 
a O 
-- O 
previous, O 
uh, O 
type O 
of O 
work O 
that O 
I O 
had. O 
And O 
I O 
and O 
tha- O 
I O 
think O 
that's O 
what O 
they O 
wanted O 
us O 
to O 
talk O 
about, O 
too, O 
right? O 
Alexander PER
Yeah. O 
Yeah, O 
that's O 
that's O 
that's O 
I O 
think O 
it's O 
just O 
basically, O 
is O 
(()) O 
one O 
of O 
the O 
things O 
I O 
perceive O 
is O 
if- O 
what O 
kind O 
of, O 
you O 
know, O 
environment O 
is O 
it, O 
and O 
is O 
it O 
inviting O 
is O 
it, O 
you O 
know, O 
all O 
that O 
they O 
I O 
guess O 
that's O 
what O 
they're O 
aiming O 
at. O 
You O 
know, O 
it's O 
not O 
a O 
place O 
where O 
everybody O 
trying O 
to O 
give O 
instruction O 
and O 
everybody O 
trying O 
to O 
do, O 
you O 
know. O 
Uh, O 
but O 
I O 
for O 
my O 
job O 
is O 
i- O 
i- O 
-- O 
we O 
have O 
us O 
a O 
very O 
diverse O 
feel. O 
We O 
have O 
a O 
lot O 
of O 
people O 
who O 
are O 
from O 
different O 
country, O 
and, O 
you O 
know, O 
and O 
-- O 
I O 
think O 
they O 
are O 
pretty O 
much O 
accepting, O 
and O 
I, O 
you O 
know, O 
I- O 
bas- O 
basically O 
you- O 
you O 
can O 
promote O 
yourself O 
if O 
you O 
do O 
a O 
good O 
job, O 
I O 
mean, O 
they O 
don't O 
pick O 
and O 
choose, O 
you O 
know. O 
Bill PER
Right. O 
Alexander PER
It's O 
a O 
very O 
-- O 
environment O 
that O 
allows O 
you O 
to O 
grow O 
in. O 
And O 
I O 
think O 
they O 
thinks O 
I O 
rightfully O 
don't, O 
if O 
-- O 
like O 
if O 
I O 
have O 
a O 
problem, O 
like, O 
I'll O 
freshly O 
go O 
to O 
my O 
team O 
lead O 
or O 
the O 
supervisor O 
and O 
she O 
takes O 
it O 
to O 
her O 
boss, O 
and, O 
you O 
know, O 
the O 
boss O 
takes O 
it O 
to O 
the O 
next O 
level O 
and, O 
you O 
know, O 
something O 
like O 
that. O 
Bill PER
Right. O 
Yeah, O 
but O 
that O 
-- O 
I O 
feel O 
like O 
that O 
that's O 
very O 
important. O 
Uh, O 
for O 
a O 
company O 
to O 
be O 
well-run, O 
it O 
has O 
to O 
have, O 
uh, O 
a O 
c- O 
it's O 
t- O 
has O 
to O 
be O 
able O 
to O 
send O 
a O 
clear O 
message O 
-- O 
as O 
to O 
how O 
to O 
handle O 
problems O 
and O 
who O 
who O 
is O 
the O 
one O 
that's O 
uh, O 
uh, O 
indicated O 
for O 
-- O 
for O 
those O 
problems O 
-- O 
to O 
handle. O 
And O 
and O 
people O 
-- O 
those O 
in O 
the O 
company O 
need O 
to O 
be O 
um O 
instructed O 
-- O 
to O 
know O 
wh- O 
where O 
their O 
relative O 
place O 
is O 
in O 
the O 
company. O 
So O 
that O 
they O 
they O 
don't O 
overstep O 
their O 
bounds. O 
Alexander PER
Yeah. O 
Bill PER
Because O 
when O 
that O 
happens, O 
and O 
it O 
that O 
makes, O 
uh, O 
that O 
creates O 
problems O 
for O 
the O 
employees. O 
It O 
makes O 
them O 
discontent. O 
I O 
mean, O 
if O 
they O 
if O 
they O 
can O 
be, O 
eh, O 
um, O 
you O 
know, O 
jumped O 
on O 
arbitrarily O 
by O 
just O 
about O 
anybody, O 
then O 
pretty O 
soon, O 
you O 
know, O 
they're O 
they're O 
they're O 
not O 
going O 
to O 
be O 
content O 
at O 
all, O 
they're O 
just O 
going O 
to O 
wonder, O 
well O 
when O 
when's O 
the O 
next O 
hit O 
going O 
to O 
come, O 
you O 
know. O 
When's O 
somebody O 
else O 
going O 
to O 
jump O 
on O 
me? O

about O 
your O

Roger PER
I O 
was O 
going O 
to O

you O 
go O 
first. O 
Diane PER
Okay, O 
it O 
doesn't O 
matter. O 
You O 
can O 
or O 
I O 
can. O 
Roger PER
You O 
can O 
go O 
first. O 
Diane PER
Okay. O 
I O 
own O 
a O 
restaurant. O 
And O 
uh O 
Roger PER
Oh O 
those O 
are O 
good. O 
Diane PER
Yeah. O 
Seventeen O 
people O 
employed O 
there. O 
Um O 
-- O 
predominantly O 
Hispanics PER
work O 
in O 
the O 
kitchen O 
area. O 
They're O 
uh O 
-- O 
well, O 
actually, O 
you O 
know O 
they're O 
some O 
of O 
my O 
cake O 
decorators O 
in O 
the O 
bakery O 
area O 
too. O 
They're O 
it's O 
it's O 
predominantly O 
a O 
Hispanic PER
run O 
organization. O 
I'm O 
not O 
Hispanic, O 
but O 
they O 
uh O 
I've O 
hired O 
uh O 
Roger PER
Yeah. O 
Diane PER
a O 
couple O 
that O 
worked O 
out O 
quite O 
well, O 
and O 
then O 
I've O 
let O 
them O 
-- O 
recommend O 
family O 
members O 
and O 
friends, O 
and O 
that O 
seems O 
to O 
have O 
been O 
a O 
really O 
-- O 
good O 
setup, O 
because O 
they're O 
-- O 
recommending O 
people O 
that O 
they O 
know O 
work O 
well, O 
and O 
-- O 
you O 
know, O 
it's O 
it's O 
uh O 
and O 
they're O 
happy O 
with O 
who O 
they're O 
working O 
with. O 
And O 
I've O 
sort O 
of O 
left O 
some O 
of O 
that O 
up O 
to O 
them. O 
I've O 
got O 
a O 
a O 
manager O 
that O 
-- O 
you O 
know, O 
she's O 
-- O 
I O 
defer O 
to O 
her O 
on O 
who O 
thinks O 
whether O 
she O 
thinks O 
I O 
should O 
hire O 
somebody O 
or O 
not. O 
And O 
I've O 
had O 
really O 
good O 
luck, O 
because O 
the O 
restaurant O 
business O 
typically O 
um O 
Roger PER
Yeah. O 
Diane PER
does O 
not O 
keep O 
people O 
very O 
long. O 
It's O 
a O 
short O 
term O 
employment, O 
and O 
I've O 
got O 
people O 
that's O 
been O 
with O 
me O 
for O 
eight, O 
nine, O 
ten O 
years O 
now. O 
You O 
know, O 
long O 
term O 
employees, O 
so O 
Roger PER
Yeah. O 
Diane PER
it's O 
-- O 
it's O 
been O 
a O 
good O 
setup. O 
Um O 
-- O 
you O 
know, O 
I've O 
got O 
the O 
older O 
ones O 
typically O 
are O 
the O 
ones O 
that O 
run O 
the O 
different O 
departments, O 
you O 
know O 
the O 
the O 
-- O 
deli O 
area O 
or O 
the O 
bakery O 
area O 
or O 
the O 
up O 
front O 
area, O 
and O 
-- O 
the O 
new O 
ones O 
kind O 
of O 
defer O 
to O 
them, O 
and O 
-- O 
it O 
sort O 
of O 
runs O 
itself. O 
I O 
feel O 
really O 
lucky. O 
I've O 
got O 
a O 
I've O 
got O 
a O 
really O 
good O 
crew. O 
Roger PER
Yeah. O 
Diane PER
I O 
think O 
I've O 
got O 
a O 
working O 
situation. O 
Roger PER
Oh, O 
okay. O 
Diane PER
S- O 
-- O 
Hey, O 
tell O 
me O 
about O 
yours. O 
Roger PER
So O 
you O 
got O 
-- O 
you O 
at O 
the O 
top, O 
but O 
you O 
got O 
a O 
manager, O 
huh? O 
Diane PER
Uh O 
uh O 
yeah. O 
I've O 
got O 
a O 
girl O 
that O 
I've O 
hired O 
uh O 
well, O 
I O 
hired O 
her, O 
let's O 
see, O 
about O 
nine O 
years O 
ago O 
-- O 
It's O 
a O 
Hispanic PER
girl O 
but O 
she O 
speaks O 
fluent O 
English O 
and O 
Spanish, O 
so O 
she O 
can O 
work O 
with O 
both O 
-- O 
you O 
know O 
either O 
language O 
problem. O 
Roger PER
That's O 
what O 
you O 
need. O 
Diane PER
And O 
she's O 
uh O 
-- O 
hard O 
worker, O 
always O 
there, O 
um O 
-- O 
everybody O 
-- O 
She O 
works O 
with O 
everybody O 
rather O 
than O 
just O 
telling O 
them O 
what O 
to O 
do, O 
and O 
they O 
respect O 
her O 
and O 
work O 
for O 
her O 
quite O 
well, O 
so O 
-- O 
I'm O 
not O 
working O

I O 
I O 
uh O

um O 
I O 
sort O

started O

might O 
step O 
down O

was O

somewhat O

although O 
you O

uh O 
no O

uh O 
the O 
I O

well O 
first O 
of O 
all, O 
you O 
know O 
I O 
agree O 
with O 
you, O 
I O 
think O 
cheating O 
on O 
your O 
wife's O 
pretty O 
low. O 
But O 
I O 
think O 
what O 
happened O 
i- O 
it's O 
living O 
the O 
b- O 
uh O

both O

uh O 
you O 
look O 
some O 
of O 
the O

they O 
had, O 
you O

he O 
had O 
a O 
few O 
bucks O 
or O 
so. O 
(()) O 
finish, O 
things O 
were O 
getting O 
him O 
down, O 
uh O 
you O

you O 
know O 
how O 
it O 
is, O 
day O 
after O

though O 
-- O 
M- O

all O 
that O 
wonderful. O 
Christina PER
Right. O 
Greg PER
Eh, O 
you O 
know O 
and O 
I O 
don't O 
think O 
he O 
had O 
faced O 
that, O 
and O 
plus, O 
you O 
know, O 
a O 
lot O 
of O 
the O 
neat O 
stuff O 
from O 
the O 
outside, O 
and O 
particularly O 
Amber PER
Frey, PER
who O 
I O 
don't O 
particularly O 
think O 
is O 
neat, O 
but O 
it O 
was O 
something O 
that O 
uh O 
you O 
know O 
he O 
went O 
after O 
Christina PER

Greg PER
and O 
so O 
uh O 
he O 
figured, O 
well O 
-- O 
these O 
will, O 
these O 
things O 
would O 
get O 
rid O

her O 
I O

I O 
don't, O 
I O 
don't O 
know O 
why O 
like O 
his O 
uh, O 
the O

-- O 
you O

the O

he, O 
just O 
-- O

you O

it's O

what O

they O 
wanted O

-- O 
you O

okay, O 
we're O 
not O 
going O

either, O 
big O 
high O

Greg PER
Well, O

you O

both O

one O 
took O

is O 
terribly O 
open- O

uh, O 
the O

It's O 
uh O 
Kelly O 
So O 
the O 
Hillary O 
a O 
pretty O 
-- O 
depressing O 
topic O 
for O 
today. O 
Kelly O 
yeah, O 
I O 
guess O 
so. O 
The O 
truth O 
is O 
I O 
don't O 
really, O 
uh, O 
I O 
don't O 
really O 
know O 
much O 
about O 
that O 
topic. O 
I O 
didn't O 
really O 
follow O 
the O 
trial O 
very O 
closely O 
at O 
all O 
Hillary O 
we O 
don't O 
have, O 
uh, O 
cable O 
so O 
we O 
purposely O 
didn't O 
watch O 
the O 
trial, O 
but O 
I O 
read O 
about O 
it O 
on O 
the O 
internet. O 
Kelly O 
so O 
Hillary O 
and O 
basically O 
Kelly O 
Oh, O 
really? O 
Hillary O 
he O 
-- O 
killed O 
his O 
wife O 
when O 
she O 
was O 
-- O 
eight O 
months O 
pregnant O 
and O 
-- O 
and O 
dumped O 
her O 
in, O 
uh O 
-- O 
the O 
ocean, O 
basically. O 
Kelly O 
So O 
why O 
was O 
it O 
so O 
special? O 
Why O 
did O 
that, O 
uh O 
-- O 
particular O 
case O 
make O 
-- O 
the O 
the O 
national O 
news? O 
Hillary O 
I O 
think O 
it's O 
because O 
it O 
was O 
in O 
such, O 
it O 
was O 
like O 
a, O 
um O 
Kelly O 
Like O 
Hillary O 
it O 
was O 
-- O 
in O 
such O 
a O 
quiet, O 
upscale O 
community O 
where O 
it O 
happened O 
and O 
-- O 
um O 
just O 
I O 
think O 
the O 
fact O 
of O 
her O 
being O 
eight O 
months O 
pregnant, O 
um, O 
drew O 
a O 
lot O 
of O 
attention O 
and O 
Kelly O 
Yeah. O 
Hillary O 
of O 
course O 
people O 
were O 
worried O 
about O 
her O 
for O 
a O 
long O 
time O 
and O 
then O 
they O 
found O 
her O 
and O 
blah O 
blah O 
blah. O 
It O 
was O 
-- O 
gossip, O 
basically. O 
Kelly O 
((Yeah, O 
right.)) O 
Oh, O 
but O 
the O 
mistress O 
had O 
nothing O 
to O 
do O 
with O 
the O 
murder? O 
Hillary O 
I O 
think O 
-- O 
yeah, O 
cause O 
he O 
found O 
out, O 
they O 
found O 
out O 
he O 
had O 
a O 
mistress, O 
and O 
then O 
it O 
was O 
like, O 
oh O 
-- O 
Yeah. O 
Are O 
-- O 
I O 
don't O 
think, O 
I O 
don't O 
think O 
so, O 
but O 
who O 
knows? O 
I O 
don't O 
know. O 
Kelly O 
Right. O 
Hillary O 
very O 
sad O 
cause O 
she O 
has O 
a O 
child O 
herself O 
and O 
so O 
she O 
drug O 
her O 
son O 
through O 
a O 
lot O 
of O 
-- O 
uh, O 
drama O 
that O 
he O 
didn't O 
need O 
to O 
be O 
part O 
of. O 
Kelly O 
Wait, O 
what O 
happened? O 
Hillary O 
I O 
don't O 
know. O 
She O 
has O 
a O 
son O 
too, O 
so O 
he O 
he O 
also O 
got O 
put O 
-- O 
um O 
-- O 
you O 
know, O 
in O 
the O 
spotlight O 
a O 
bit, O 
from O 
what O 
I O 
understand. O 
I O 
didn't, O 
I O 
don't O 
have O 
TV O 
though, O 
so O 
I O 
don't O 
really O 
know. O 
Kelly O 
Oh, O 
the O 
son O 
of O 
the, O 
right O 
right. O 
Hillary O 
of O 
-- O 
of O 
his O 
girlfriend, O 
yeah. O 
Kelly O 
Yeah. O 
Hillary O 
I O 
don't O 
know. O 
I O 
hear O 
though, O 
that O 
he's O 
going O 
to O 
be O 
-- O 
the O 
first O 
person O 
to O 
be O 
(()) O 
um O 
-- O 
uh O 
-- O 
killed O 
for O 
a O 
crime O 
in O 
California O 
in O 
like, O 
thirty O 
five O 
years O 
or O 
something. O 
Oh. O 
Kelly O 
Oh, O 
really? O 
Hillary O 
I O 
don't O 
know O 
if O 
they've, O 
I O 
don't O 
know O 
if O 
they've O 
-- O 
um O 
-- O 
given O 
him O 
the O 
death O 
penalty O 
yet. O 
But O 
I O 
think O 
he O 
would O 
be O 
the O 
first O 
in, O 
in O 
a O 
really O 
long O 
time O 
to O 
actually O 
-- O 
be O 
killed. O 
Kelly O 
Yeah, O 
that's O 
amazing. O 
Hillary O 
I O 
don't O 
Kelly O 
Um O 
-- O 
why, O 
uh, O 
now O 
why O 
did O 
they O 
decide O 
that O 
this O 
was O 
to O 
be O 
this O 
big O 
(()) O 
out O 
of O 
this O 
with O 
the O 
most O 
heinous O 
crime O 
in O 
all O 
of O 
California? O 
Hillary O 
well, O 
you O 
know O 
Kelly O 
I O 
mean O 
I O 
guess O 
that's O 
not O 
how O 
they O 
decide O 
who O 
died, O 
but O 
it's O 
because O 
of O 
the O 
Hillary O 
you O 
know, O 
and O 
Kelly O 
the, O 
uh, O 
cou-, O 
like O 
the O 
-- O 
the O 
court O 
that O 
they O 
went O 
to, O 
like O 
the O 
area O 
doesn't O 
Hillary O 
well, O 
I O 
don't O 
know O 
why O 
they O 
decided O 
on O 
this, O 
I O 
think O 
it O 
was O 
because O 
it O 
was O 
so O 
public O 
of O 
a O 
case. O 
But O 
they O 
have O 
a O 
lot O 
of O 
Kelly O 
Yeah. O 
Hillary O 
they O 
have O 
many O 
many O 
worse O 
crimes O 
going O 
on O 
in O 
California, O 
parents O 
killing O 
their O 
children O 
and O 
everything, O 
that O 
you O 
would O 
think O 
-- O 
would O 
would, O 
um O 
-- O 
you O 
know, O 
be O 
Kelly O 
Hearing O 
more. O 
Hillary O 
be O 
more O 
Kelly O 
Stringent O 
penalties, O 
Hillary O 
yeah, O 
but O 
they O 
don't, O 
they O 
ignore O 
those O 
because O 
this O 
one O 
got O 
on O 
television, O 
I O 
guess. O 
Kelly O 
keep O 
like O 
-- O 
uh, O 
the O 
jury O 
from O 
watching O 
~TV O 
and O 
the O 
media O 
and O 
stuff. O 
But O 
I O 
guess O 
now O 
((it's, O 
uh)) O 
-- O 
pretty O 
much O 
impossible O 
-- O 
to O 
do. O 
Hillary O 
I O 
i O 
don't O 
know. O 
I O 
never O 
really O 
got O 
the O 
whole O 
-- O 
watching O 
it O 
on O 
~TV O 
and O 
and O 
getting O 
into O 
the O 
whole O 
-- O 
mystery O 
of O 
it O 
because, O 
in O 
the O 
end, O 
the O 
woman's O 
dead O 
and O 
so O 
is O 
her O 
child O 
and O 
-- O 
and O 
-- O 
there's O 
-- O 
really O 
no O 
way O 
of O 
changing O 
that O 
I O 
guess. O 
Kelly O 
Yeah, O 
uh, O 
I O 
think O 
it's O 
kind O 
of O 
strange O 
how O 
it O 
was O 
so O 
publicized. O 
Like O 
I'm O 
just, O 
seriously, O 
like O 
I O 
don't, O 
like O 
I O 
try O 
not O 
to O 
watch, O 
like O 
-- O 
too O 
much, O 
like O 
Hillary O 
You O 
can't O 
help O 
it O 
sometimes. O 
Kelly O 
Yeah O 
I O 
know. O 
But O 
it O 
just O 
amazes O 
me O 
that, O 
uh, O 
I O 
think O 
it's O 
ridiculous O 
how O 
publicized O 
-- O 
how O 
much O 
publicity O 
it O 
got O 
because O 
-- O 
I O 
mean O 
there's O 
like O 
human O 
rights O 
violations O 
going O 
on O 
all O 
around O 
the O 
world. O 
I O 
mean O 
there's O 
like, O 
genocide O 
in O 
Sudan O 
right O 
now O 
but O 
like, O 
nobody O 
talks O 
about O 
that. O 
That's O 
like O 
(()) O 
Hillary O 
Oh O 
yeah O 
and O 
what's O 
going O 
on O 
in, O 
I O 
know O 
and O 
people O 
-- O 
flock, O 
flock O 
to O 
the O 
store O 
to O 
buy O 
all O 
their O 
-- O 
all O 
their O 
foreign O 
made O 
goods O 
and O 
it's O 
like O 
what O 
are O 
you O 
-- O 
doing? O 
Obviously O 
they O 
don't O 
really O 
care O 
about O 
what's O 
going O 
on. O 
They O 
just O 
like O 
to O 
hear O 
the O 
details. O 
Maybe O 
if O 
they O 
could O 
hear O 
the O 
details O 
about O 
other O 
things O 
they O 
would O 
be O 
more O 
involved. O 
I O 
don't O 
know. O 
Kelly O 
Um O 
(()) O 
it's O 
almost O 
like, O 
uh O 
-- O 
(()) O 
diversion O 
but O 
it O 
just O 
seems O 
like O 
they O 
just O 
make O 
it O 
into O 
like, O 
like O 
a O 
soap O 
opera O 
for O 
people O 
to O 
watch, O 
you O 
know? O 
Hillary O 
Well O 
you O 
know, O 
some O 
people O 
were O 
glued O 
to O 
their O 
~TVs O 
for O 
weeks, O 
and O 
it's O 
just O 
to O 
disturbing O 
that O 
that O 
would O 
be O 
their O 
-- O 
their O 
main O 
entertainment O 
during O 
the O 
day. O 
Kelly O 
Oh O 
yeah, O 
definitely. O 
It's O 
creepy. O 
Hillary O 
Especially O 
when O 
there's O 
so O 
many O 
other O 
things O 
they O 
could O 
be O 
doing. O 
We O 
have O 
three O 
kids. O 
I O 
could O 
not O 
sit O 
around O 
all O 
day O 
and O 
watch O 
a O 
murder O 
trial O 
on O 
~TV, O 
especially O 
with O 
my O 
kids O 
around. O

Laci PER

their O 
unborn O

and O 
he O 
now O 
faces O 
the O

Do O 
you O 
think O 
he O 
is O 
guilty O 
of O 
the O 
crimes O 
he's O 
been O 
convicted O 
of? O 
If O 
so, O 
what O 
were O 
his O 
motives? O 
How O 
closely O 
did O 
you O 
follow O 
the O 
trial O 
and O 
what O 
do O 
you O 
think O 
of O 
all O 
of O 
the O 
media O 
coverage O 
of O 
the O 
trial? O 
What O 
kind O 
of O 
sentencing O 
should O 
Peterson PER
receive? O 
A O 
Uh, O 
there O 
there's O 
something O 
about O 
this O 
Scott PER
Peterson PER
trial, O 
though, O 
that O 
the O 
th- O 
that O 
I O 
can't O 
I O 
can't O 
recall O 
hearing. O 
Did O 
the O 
-- O 
are O 
they O 
still O 
going O 
to O 
try O 
to O 
get O 
him O 
with, O 
uh, O 
the O 
death O 
penalty O 
or O 
are O 
they O 
-- O 
-- O 
or O 
are O 
they O 
going O 
to O 
be O 
content O 
with O 
just, O 
uh, O 
just, O 
you O 
know, O 
giving O 
him O 
life, O 
uh, O 
have O 
heard O 
about O 
that? O 
B O 
Um, O 
A O 
I O 
mean, O 
are O 
are O 
they O 
still O 
going O 
to O 
go O 
after O 
him O 
with O 
al- O 
with O 
all O 
their O 
-- O 
all O 
of O 
their O 
ability? O 
Eh, O 
you O 
know, O 
are O 
they O 
-- O 
are O 
they O 
s- O 
B O 
I O 
think O 
if O 
they O 
do O 
-- O 
if O 
they O 
-- O 
th- O 
I O 
think O 
that O 
they O 
can O 
-- O 
because O 
-- O 
in O 
California, O 
uh, O 
the O 
baby O 
was O 
considered O 
a O 
person O 
A O 
Yeah, O 
yeah. O 
So, O 
th- O 
then O 
an- O 
B O 
and O 
they O 
had O 
a O 
little O 
bit O 
about O 
that O 
at O 
church O 
last O 
week O 
-- O 
when O 
I O 
went O 
to O 
church O 
services, O 
or O 
the O 
week O 
before, O 
I O 
can't O 
remember, O 
but, O 
um, O 
it O 
-- O 
I O 
kind O 
of O 
thought O 
then O 
-- O 
that, O 
uh, O 
when O 
I O 
first O 
heard O 
about O 
the O 
case, O 
let O 
me O 
just O 
back O 
up O 
a O 
little O 
bit. O 
A O 
Yeah. O 
B O 
When O 
I O 
first O 
-- O 
heard O 
the O 
case, O 
or O 
about O 
it, O 
I O 
-- O 
told O 
myself, O 
if O 
he O 
did O 
do O 
it, O 
A O 
Yeah, O 
he O 
probably O 
did. O 
B O 
and O 
I O 
think O 
he O 
did, O 
A O 
Yeah. O 
B O 
uh, O 
if O 
he O 
did O 
do O 
it, O 
I O 
-- O 
thought O 
to O 
myself, O 
he O 
will O 
probably O 
get O 
-- O 
the O 
maximum O 
sentence O 
of O 
whatever O 
it O 
is O 
A O 
Well, O 
he O 
he O 
he O 
probably O 
will, O 
yeah. O 
B O 
because O 
of O 
the O 
baby O 
A O 
Yeah. O 
B O 
and, O 
to O 
me, O 
I O 
-- O 
don't O 
believe O 
even O 
-- O 
eh, O 
exactly, O 
you O 
know, O 
fetal O 
state, O 
I O 
believe O 
that O 
that O 
was O 
a O 
baby O 
-- O 
that O 
could've O 
lived. O 
A O 
Right, O 
a O 
human O 
being, O 
yeah. O 
B O 
So, O 
to O 
me, O 
I O 
wouldn't O 
-- O 
he- O 
it O 
wouldn't've O 
been O 
good O 
if O 
he O 
-- O 
if O 
I O 
had O 
been O 
on O 
his O 
jury. O 
A O 
Mm, O 
yeah, O 
I O 
see O 
what O 
you O 
mean. O 
B O 
I O 
could O 
never O 
vote, O 
I O 
mean, O 
to O 
let O 
him O 
go. O 
A O 
Well, O 
you O 
know O 
B O 
I O 
c- O 
but, O 
now, O 
I O 
don't O 
know O 
that O 
I O 
would O 
vote O 
for O 
a O 
death O 
penalty O 
because O 
I'm O 
not O 
sure O 
that O 
a O 
-- O 
a O 
death O 
cancels O 
out O 
a O 
death. O 
A O 
Right, O 
yeah. O 
B O 
I'm O 
not O 
-- O 
-- O 
I O 
I O 
don't O 
know, O 
and O 
-- O 
I O 
wouldn't O 
really O 
be O 
able O 
to O 
vote O 
-- O 
on O 
that O 
because O 
my O 
father O 
was O 
killed O 
at O 
work. O 
A O 
Oh, O 
I'm O 
sorry O 
to O 
hear O 
that. O 
B O 
So, O 
you O 
think O 
you O 
-- O 
-- O 
so, O 
you O 
know, O 
I O 
I've O 
got O 
two O 
things O 
that O 
probably O 
-- O 
I O 
would O 
be O 
disqualified O 
on O 
that O 
kind O 
of O 
a O 
jury. O 
A O 
Yeah, O 
maybe O 
so. O 
B O 
Well, O 
I'm O 
pretty O 
sure O 
of O 
it. O 
A O 
Well, O 
uh- O 
B O 
But, O 
uh, O 
believe O 
it O 
or O 
not, O 
I O 
do O 
still O 
feel O 
sorry O 
for O 
him O 
A O 
Uh, O 
wh- O 
yeah, O 
I O 
do O 
too. O 
I O 
feel O 
sorry O 
for O 
him. O 
B O 
because, O 
uh, O 
A O 
He's O 
going O 
to O 
be O 
in O 
the O 
B O 
more O 
so O 
for O 
his O 
family O 
-- O 
m- O 
more O 
so O 
for O 
both O 
families O 
-- O 
because O 
I O 
know O 
that O 
from O 
my O 
own O 
experience, O 
we're O 
the O 
one's O 
that O 
are O 
left. O 
A O 
Well, O 
he's O 
also O 
being, O 
uh, O 
you O 
know, O 
dragged O 
through, O 
uh, O 
the O 
media, O 
you O 
know, O 
uh, O 
B O 
Now, O 
to O 
to O 
me O 
that O 
was O 
A O 
the O 
nation-wi- O 
nation-wide O

I O

I O 
read O 
about O 
it O 
in O 
the O

things O

that. O 
Um, O 
I O 
do O 
think O 
from O 
all O 
the, O 
uh, O 
things O 
that O 
I O 
have O 
heard O 
that O 
he O 
-- O 
had O 
to O 
be O 
guilty O 
with O 
all O 
the O 
evidence O 
that O 
they O 
had, O 
but O 
um, O 
I O 
don't O 
really O 
know O 
why, O 
uh, O 
if O 
everybody O 
was O 
so, O 
sort O 
of, O 
obsessed O 
about O 
it O

we've O

other O

that, O 
uh, O 
seem O 
to O 
me O 
much O 
more O 
important, O 
but O 
um. O 
Perhaps O 
it O 
was O 
because O 
he O 
seemed, O 
uh, O 
a O 
very O 
human O 
kind O 
of O 
person O 
and, O 
and O 
you O 
cou- O 
you O 
couldn't O 
really O 
understand O 
why O 
he O 
would O 
want O 
to O 
do O 
something O 
about O 
that. O 
I- O 
I O 
think O 
his O 
motive O 
must O 
have O 
been O 
to O 
be O 
with O 
his O 
new O 
girlfriend, O 
but O 
uh- O 
-- O 
kill O 
his O 
own O

very O 
frankly, O 
I O

from O 
what O 
I O 
can O 
observe,that O 
it O

eh, O 
it O 
has O 
been O 
talking O 
-- O 
-- O 
taking O 
too O 
long O

Like O 
one O

almost, O 
now. O 
It O 
was- O 
Jean PER

you O

It O 
was O

it's O 
really O 
a O 
good O

why O 
it O 
took O 
such O 
a O 
long O

uh O 
they're O

yesterday O

something O 
that O 
his O

-- O 
I O 
guess O 
it O 
was O 
on O 
the O 
television. O 
In O 
the O

his O 
brother O 
was O 
appealing O 
-- O 
for O 
them O 
to O 
to O 
sentence O 
him O 
to O 
-- O 
to O 
prison O 
for O 
life O 
rather O 
than O 
the O 
death O 
penalty, O 
because O 
-- O 
he O 
said O 
he's O 
a O 
very O 
good O 
listener O 
and O 
he O 
cares O 
about O 
people, O 
and O 
and O 
he O 
might O 
be O 
able O 
to O 
help O 
a O 
lot O 
of O 
people O 
in O 
prison. O 
I O 
don't O 
know O 
whether O 
that O 
is O 
true O 
or O 
not. O 
I O 
know O 
that O 
he O 
had O 
done O 
a O 
lot O 
of O 
volunteer O 
things O 
before, O 
and O 
that O 
was O 
the O 
one O 
things O 
that O 
made O 
me O 
wonder O 
there O 
was O 
any O 
possible O 
chance O 
that O 
it O 
could O 
have O 
been O 
somebody O

I O

did O

day O 
by O 
day O

anything O 
like O 
that, O 
I O 
don't O 
quite O 
see O 
how O 
he O 
could O 
not O 
be O 
guilty O 
if O 
they've O 
got O 
so O 
much O 
that O 
appears O

him. O

what O 
would O

weapons, O 
ah, O 
which O 
is O 
used O 
to O 
-- O 
oppress O 
and O 
-- O 
to O 
kill O 
a O 
lot O 
of O 
Palestinians. PER
So, O 
for O 
me, O 
that's O 
-- O 
the- O 
that's O 
essentially O 
the O 
root O 
of O 
the O 
problem. O 
And, O 
um, O 
Yasser PER
Arafat PER
was O 
kind O 
of O 
in O 
a O 
difficult O 
position, O 
because O 
you O 
have O 
these, O 
um, O 
incredibly O 
-- O 
oppressed O 
and O 
in O 
some O 
ways O 
imprisoned, O 
uh, O 
Palestinians, PER
and O 
if O 
-- O 
Arafat PER
hadn't, O 
um, O 
tried O 
to O 
stand O 
up O 
-- O 
and O 
help O 
them O 
and- O 
and O 
fight O 
for O 
their O 
rights, O 
then O 
-- O 
m- O 
they O 
wouldn't O 
have O 
respected O 
Arafat, PER
but O 
then O 
again, O 
you O 
know, O 
he O 
couldn't O 
be O 
too O 
friendly O 
with O 
the O 
West, O 
um, O 
and, O 
um, O 
and O 
so O 
he O 
did O 
the O 
best O 
he O 
could, O 
I O 
think. O 
It's O 
a O 
difficult O 
-- O 
leadership O 
role. O 
Gandhi PER
Mhm. O 
Marco PER
Yeah. O 
Um, O 
what O 
do- O 
Well, O 
how O 
about O 
you? O 
Gandhi PER
I O 
think, O 
yeah, O 
more O 
or O 
less, O 
I O 
c- O 
I O 
agree O 
with O 
what O 
you O 
said. O 
It's O 
almost, O 
this O 
is O 
my O 
view O 
as O 
well. O 
And O 
the O 
question O 
is, O 
what O 
next? O 
I O 
mean, O 
some O 
idea O 
-- O 
from O 
Israeli O 
side, O 
they O 
were O 
saying O 
-- O 
he O 
was O 
a O 
problem, O 
and O 
if O 
he O 
goes, O 
everything O 
will O 
be O 
quite O 
easy. O 
Marco PER
Yeah. O 
Gandhi PER
Fine. O 
Now O 
he's O 
not O 
in O 
anymore. O 
Marco PER
Yeah. O 
Gandhi PER
So, O 
let O 
us O 
wait O 
and O 
see. O 
Hope. O 
If O 
he O 
was O 
a O 
problem O 
himself, O 
hope O 
-uh, O 
the O 
coming O 
one O 
-- O 
will O 
be O 
in O 
a O 
good O 
-- O 
position O 
to O 
negotiate O 
with O 
the O 
other O 
side, O 
Israel, O 
and O 
then O 
-- O 
peace O 
can O 
be O 
achieved. O 
Marco PER
Yeah. O 
Gandhi PER
Uh, O 
we O 
have O 
to O 
wait O 
and O 
see, O 
but, O 
uh, O 
it O 
seems O 
it's O 
not O 
easy. O 
Marco PER
But, O 
I, O 
eh, O 
I O 
get O 
the O 
feeling O 
that- O 
-- O 
It's O 
almost- O 
-- O 
The O 
peace O 
process- O 
We O 
can't O 
put O 
it O 
on O 
-- O 
the O 
ro- O 
or O 
the- O 
-- O 
the O 
whole O 
responsibility O 
of O 
the O 
pre- O 
-- O 
peace O 
process O 
can't O 
be O 
the O 
leader O 
of O 
-- O 
a- O 
-- O 
a O 
group O 
that O 
is- O 
-- O 
I O 
don't O 
know, O 
in O 
my O 
view, O 
has O 
-- O 
not O 
ver- O 
not O 
very O 
many O 
resources O 
to O 
fight- O 
-- O 
to O 
fight O 
this O 
-- O 
battle O 
that O 
-- O 
their O 
trying O 
to O 
fight O 
against O 
-- O 
a O 
government O 
that O 
has O 
taken O 
away O 
a O 
lot O 
of O 
their O 
land, O 
that, O 
you O 
know, O 
doesn't O 
allow O 
them O 
to O 
really O 
move O 
around O 
in O 
their O 
own O 
country. O 
So, O 
unless O 
that O 
-- O 
stops, O 
the, O 
um, O 
the O 
leader O 
of O 
the O 
Palestinians PER
-- O 
really O 
can't O 
do O 
too O 
much O 
-- O 
to O 
further O 
the O 
peace O 
process, O 
because O 
-- O 
there O 
are O 
-- O 
a O 
lot O 
of O 
bad O 
things O 
happening O 
to O 
the O 
people O 
-- O 
of O 
that O 
-- O 
leader. O 
Gandhi PER
That's O 
correct, O 
as O 
well. O 
Marco PER
Yeah, O 
so O 
it's- O 
-- O 
it's O 
kind O 
of, O 
it's- O 
-- O 
it O 
seems O 
like O 
the, O 
um, O 
the O 
media, O 
at O 
least O 
in O 
the O 
United O 
States, O 
is O 
-- O 
putting O 
all O 
of O 
this O 
-- O 
focus O 
and O 
responsibility O 
on O 
the O 
leader O 
of O 
the O 
Palestinians, PER
as O 
if O 
it O 
was O 
Gandhi PER
Marco PER
Arafat's PER
fault O 
that O 
any O 
of- O 
-- O 
any O 
of O 
the O 
violence O 
was O 
caused. O 
So, O 
it O 
seems O 
like O 
an O 
unfair O 
treatment O 
-- O 
of- O 
-- O 
of, O 
you O 
know, O 
the O 
leader O 
of O 
-- O 
the O 
Palestinian O 
people. O 
Um, O 
yeah. O 
Gandhi PER
Yes. O 
That's O 
absolutely O 
correct. O 
Yeah. O 
Marco PER
Yeah. O 
Hm. O 
Gandhi PER
Actually, O 
it- O 
it's O 
a O 
good O 
topic O 
to O 
be O 
choosing, O 
I O 
mean, O 
uh, O 
because O 
it's O 
one O 
of O 
the O 
fresh O 
topics. O 
Marco PER
Yeah. O 
Gandhi PER
How O 
long O 
have O 
you O 
been O 
with O 
the O 
study? O 
Marco PER
Uh, O 
this O 
is O 
probably O 
my O 
tenth O 
or O 
eleventh O 
conversation. O 
Gandhi PER
Tenth, O 
eleven. O 
Almost O 
the O 
same O 
like O 
me. O 
So, O 
the O 
other O 
-- O 
days, O 
which O 
one O 
was O 
quite O 
interesting O 
to O 
you? O 
Marco PER
Um, O 
well, O 
there's O 
been O 
a O 
couple O 
where O 
-- O 
they've- O 
they O 
talked O 
about O 
the O 
Cabinet O 
-- O 
for O 
-- O 
Bush, PER
and O 
Bush PER
has O 
been, O 
um, O 
you O 
know, O 
selecting O 
new O 
Cabinet O 
members O 
and O 
-- O 
all O 
of O 
the O 
new O 
members O 
are O 
people O 
that O 
I'm- O 
I O 
don't O 
really O 
know O 
very O 
well. O 
So, O 
there's O 
been O 
some O 
topics O 
where O 
I'm- O 
I O 
didn't O 
have O 
very O 
much O 
information. O 
Other O 
topics O 
-- O 
you O 
know, O 
usually O 
about O 
the O 
election O 
that- O 
-- O 
that, O 
um, O 
I O 
did O 
have O 
-- O 
a O 
lot O 
of O 
things, O 
um, O 
to O 
say. O 
Yeah. O 
Are O 
you- O 
are O 
you, O 
um, O 
are O 
you O 
from O 
the O 
United O 
States, O 
or O 
do O 
you O 
come O 
from, O 
uh- O 
Gandhi PER
I O 
came O 
from O 
the O 
area, O 
I'm O 
from O 
Egypt. O 
Marco PER
You're O 
from O 
Egypt. O 
Gandhi PER
Yeah, O 
so O 
I'm- O 
I'm O 
quite, O 
uh, O 
Marco PER
So O 
you- O 
Gandhi PER
-cerned O 
about, O 
uh- O 
-- O 
uh, O 
over O 
there O 
I O 
mean. O 
People, O 
actually, O 
they O 
are O 
waiting O 
-- O 
to, O 
uh, O 
to O 
see O 
peace O 
is O 
a O 
fact. O 
Actually, O 
in O 
both O 
sides, O 
Marco PER
Yeah. O

you O

Arafat's PER
death O 
will O 
help O

hurt O 
the O

good O

What O

you O

US O 
policy O 
should O

toward O 
Palestine O 
now O 
that O

Pouring O

Oh, O

you O

reprieve, O 
because O 
our O

good O 
for O

And O 
we're O 
talking O 
about O 
Arafat PER
here. O

Yes, O 
Arafat. PER
Let's O 
talk O 
about O 
Arafat. PER
What O 
do O 
you O 
think? O 
Ben PER
Huh. O 
What O 
do O 
I O 
think? O 
Um, O 
well, O 
when O 
-- O 
around O 
the O 
time O 
he O 
was O 
he O 
was O 
getting O 
the O 
Nobel O 
Peace O 
Prize O 
and O 
stuff, O 
I O 
think O 
he O 
got O 
that. O 
Sue PER
Yes, O 
he O 
did. O 
Ben PER
Um, O 
there O 
was O 
a O 
show O 
here O 
in O 
New O 
York O 
at O 
a O 
big O 
theater. O 
I O 
think O 
maybe O 
it O 
was O 
at O 
Lincoln O 
Center O 
in O 
the O 
Philharmonic O 
Theater O 
or O 
the O 
Metropolitan O 
Opera O 
House O 
or O 
the O 
New O 
York O 
State O 
Theater O 
or O 
something. O 
And O 
Arafat PER
came O 
in O 
and O 
got O 
a O 
standing O 
ovation, O 
you O 
know, O 
a O 
peace O 
prize O 
winner O 
bah O 
bah O 
bah O 
bah O 
bah. O 
The O 
mayor O 
of O 
New O 
York, O 
who O 
was O 
then O 
Rudolph PER
Giuliani, PER
stood O 
up O 
and O 
walked O 
out, O 
he O 
was O 
also O 
in O 
attendance, O 
and O 
his, O 
uh, O 
comment O 
to O 
the O 
press O 
afterwards O 
was O 
that, O 
you O 
know, O 
he O 
just O 
didn't O 
want O 
to O 
honor O 
a O 
terrorist, O 
and O 
I O 
-- O 
one O 
of O 
the O 
few O 
things O 
that O 
I O 
was O 
happy O 
about O 
with O 
Giuliani PER
when O 
he O 
was O 
mayor. PER
Sue PER
Mhm. O 
Ben PER
Uh, O 
Giuliani PER
got O 
very O 
popular O 
later O 
because O 
of O 
the- O 
the O 
Sue PER
Nine O 
eleven. O 
Ben PER
World O 
Trade O 
Center O 
thing O 
but O 
he- O 
he O 
wasn't O 
so O 
popular O 
as O 
a O 
mayor. O 
Sue PER
Yeah. O 
Right, O 
I O 
knew O 
that. O 
Ben PER
But, O 
you O 
know, O 
I- O 
I O 
kind O 
of O 
agreed O 
with O 
that O 
Arafat PER
thing, O 
though. O 
I O 
-- O 
but O 
I O 
do O 
think O 
he O 
accomplished O 
something O 
in O 
that O 
the O 
Palestinian O 
people O 
do O 
have O 
a O 
legitimate O 
grievance O 
and O 
he O 
put O 
it O 
on O 
the O 
map, O 
you O 
know. O 
Sue PER
Well, O 
he- O 
-- O 
he O 
did O 
but O 
I O 
think O 
he O 
really O 
failed O 
miserably, O 
in O 
my O 
opinion, O 
when O 
he, O 
um, O 
refused O 
to O 
sign O 
that O 
treaty O 
that O 
was O 
originally O 
set O 
up O 
because O 
it O 
was O 
a O 
wonderful O 
-- O 
option O 
and O 
it O 
really O 
could've O 
re- O 
done O 
some O 
wonderful O 
things O 
for O 
his O 
people O 
and O 
I O 
think O 
he O 
really O 
did O 
them O 
a O 
disservice O 
by O 
not O 
taking O 
care O 
of O 
it O 
at O 
that O 
time. O 
Ben PER
Uh-huh. O 
Uh-huh. O 
Yeah, O 
what O 
was O 
the O 
treaty? O 
I'm O 
not O 
familiar O 
with O 
it. O 
Sue PER
Well, O 
um, O 
where O 
they O 
were O 
going O 
to, O 
uh, O 
give O 
them, O 
like, O 
ninety-six O 
percent O 
of O 
the O 
Ga- O 
of- O 
of O 
Gaza LOC
and O 
he O 
said O 
that O 
he O 
wanted O 
all O 
hundred O 
percent. O 
And O 
so O 
he O 
refused O 
to O 
sign O 
it. O 
It O 
was O 
just O 
an- O 
an O 
incredible O 
faux O 
pas O 
on O 
his O 
part, O 
from O 
my O 
opinion. O 
Ben PER
Oh. O 
Yeah. O 
Yeah, O 
y- O 
it's- O 
it's O 
-- O 
you O 
have O 
to O 
sometimes O 
take O 
a O 
little O 
bit O 
less O 
than O 
you O 
want, O 
you O 
know, O 
uh, O 
an- O 
and O 
ninety-six O 
percent O 
is O 
a O 
big O 
percentage, O 
you O 
know. O 
Sue PER
Yes. O 
And O 
I O 
think O 
that O 
could O 
have O 
really O 
done O 
some O 
wonderful O 
uh O 
steps O 
for O 
-- O 
uh O 
for O 
the O 
Palestinian O 
people O 
uh O 
as O 
a O 
whole. O 
And O 
I O 
felt O 
-- O 
very O 
sad O 
that, O 
um, O 
that O 
that O 
wasn't O 
-- O 
done. O 
It O 
really O 
should've O 
been. O 
Um, O 
it O 
was O 
really O 
quite O 
unfortunate O 
that- O 
that O 
he O 
-- O 
that O 
he O 
was O 
not O 
willing O 
to, O 
um, O 
step O 
forward O 
-- O 
to O 
do- O 
do O 
what O 
was O 
really O 
in O 
the O 
best O 
interests O 
of O 
his O 
people. O 
Ben PER
Sometimes- O 
sometimes O 
I O 
th- O 
I O 
think O 
it's O 
hard O 
when- O 
when O 
you're O 
the- O 
the O 
first O 
leader, O 
or O 
the O 
George O 
Washington O 
of O 
something, O 
to O 
see O 
things O 
other O 
than O 
in O 
black O 
and O 
white. O 
You O 
know, O 
or O 
maybe O 
he O 
didn't O 
have O 
the O 
gift O 
of- O 
of O 
nuance O 
that O 
would've O 
helped O 
him O 
to- O 
-- O 
to O 
take O 
that O 
right O 
step, O 
uh, O 
you O 
know, O 
the- O 
-- O 
the O 
-- O 
his O 
people O 
suffer O 
so O 
terribly O 
and O 
maybe, O 
you O 
know, O 
it O 
could O 
have O 
been O 
better O 
if O 
he O 
had O 
signed O 
that, O 
huh. O 
Sue PER
I O 
really O 
think O 
so. O 
I O 
really, O 
truly O 
do O 
and O 
now O 
it's O 
a- O 
a O 
situation O 
where, O 
with O 
his O 
passing, O 
um, O 
I O 
think O 
there's O 
a O 
real, O 
um, O 
new O 
opening, O 
a O 
new O 
possibility O 
for- O 
-- O 
some O 
extremely O 
positive O 
steps O 
to O 
come O 
forward O 
out O 
of O 
this O 
-- O 
I O 
do O 
think O 
that O 
the O 
United O 
States O 
-- O 
will O 
probably O 
be O 
requested O 
to O 
be O

that O 
his O

-- O

I O 
got O 
to O 
the O 
-- O 
to- O 
to O 
the O 
level O 
of O 
power O 
that O 
he O 
was O 
in O

back O 
in O 
the O 
eighties O 
-- O 
and O 
once O 
he, O 
um, O 
you O

started O

wealthy O 
and O 
started O 
getting O 
known, O 
that O 
his O

ch- O 
uh, O 
changed O 
Barb O 
Mhm. O 
Roger O 
but O 
it O 
wasn't O 
actually O 
for O 
peace O 
but O 
was O 
to O 
try O 
to O 
find O 
a O 
way O 
to O 
((send)) O 
the O 
Israelis O 
out O 
of O 
Jerusalem O 
in O 
the O

they O

I O 
really O 
don't O 
think O 
that O 
-- O 
they O 
wanted O 
to O

I O 
think O 
that, O

he O 
wanted O 
-- O 
you O 
know, O 
all O 
his O 
people O 
-- O 
all O 
his O 
people O 
wanted O 
to O

the O

I O

his O 
death O

marks O 
a O 
beginning O 
of O 
trying O 
to O 
find O 
somebody O 
that O 
-- O 
really O 
wants O 
peace. O 
I O 
don't O 
think O 
that O 
in O 
that O 
area O 
of O 
the, O 
um, O 
world O 
that O 
you O 
could O 
actually O 
have O 
peace. O 
If O 
you O 
know O 
the O 
Bible O 
well O 
you O 
would O 
know O 
that O 
there's O 
always O 
going O 
to O 
be O 
a O 
conflict O 
there. O 
Um, O 
I O 
think O 
that, O 
uh, O 
the O 
United O 
States O 
should O 
open O 
up O 
-- O 
their O 
-- O 
doors O 
to O

not O 
help, O 
but O 
support O 
any, O

for O

I O 
don't O

that O 
we O 
should O 
get O 
involved O

a O 
level, O 
a O 
point O 
where O 
we're O 
sending O

and, O 
um, O 
trying O 
to O 
-- O 
help O 
keep O 
the O 
peace O 
or O 
anything O 
like O 
that, O 
um. O 
There's O 
a O 
lot O 
of O 
stuff O 
that O 
can O 
be O 
done O 
-- O 
by O 
just O 
verbal O 
suppo- O 
-- O 
you O 
know. O 
I O 
think O 
that O 
now O 
he's O 
gone, O 
his O 
family O 
is O 
still O 
around, O 
and O 
Barb O 
Yeah. O 
Roger O 
uh, O 
millions O 
and O 
millions O 
of O

that O 
he O 
had O 
is O 
still O 
around O 
but O 
they O 
-- O 
if O 
they O 
bring O 
people O 
in O 
that O 
wasn't O 
involved O 
with O 
his O 
cabinet, O 
n- O 
um, O 
have O 
different O 
views O 
than O 
him, O 
somebody O 
that O 
gener- O 
genuinely O 
can O 
accept O 
the O 
fact O 
that O 
the O 
Israel- O 
-- O 
Is- O 
Israelis O 
are O 
there O 
and O 
they're O 
there O 
to O 
stay O 
-- O 
and, O 
um, O 
we O 
going O 
to O 
have O 
to O 
find O 
a O 
way O 
to O 
coexist. O 
If O 
they O 
can O 
find O 
somebody O 
like O 
that, O 
then O 
I O 
think O 
that O 
they O 
should O 
f- O 
support O 
him O 
and, O 
um, O 
and O 
back O 
him O 
up O 
-- O 
in O 
trying O 
to O 
help O 
define O 
-- O 
peace O 
in O 
the O 
area O 
where O 
peace O 
is O 
impossible. O 
What O 
do O 
you O 
think O 
about O 
it? O 
Barb O 
I O 
agree O 
with O 
you. O 
I O 
didn't O 
know O 
that O 
much O 
about O 
it, O 
I O 
wasn't O 
much O 
into O 
politics O 
back O 
in O 
the O 
eighties. O 
I O 
was O 
more, O 
um, O 
kind O 
of O 
a O 
-- O 
I O 
was O 
a O 
kid O 
on O 
the O 
run O 
from O 
abusive O 
parents O 
back O 
then O 
so O 
that O 
wasn't O 
a, O 
you O 
know, O 
one O 
of O 
my O 
topics O 
of O 
interest O 
at O 
the O 
time, O 
it O 
is O 
now. O 
Um, O 
I O 
-- O 
my O 
roommate, O 
and O 
I O 
still O 
don't O 
know O 
that O 
much O 
about O 
-- O 
I'd O 
love O 
to O 
know O 
more O 
about O 
politics O 
and O 
I'm O 
trying O 
to O 
learn O 
more, O 
uh, O 
tells O 
me, O 
you O 
know, O 
he O 
was O 
such O 
a O 
terrible O 
man O 
but, O 
eh, O 
I O 
don't O 
listen O 
to O 
everything O 
he O 
says. O 
And O 
I O 
think O 
it O 
-- O 
-- O 
I O 
mean, O 
it O 
would O 
be O 
nice O 
to O 
have O 
peace O 
over O 
there, O 
but O 
I O 
agree O 
with O 
you, O 
I O 
don't O 
think O 
it's O 
ever O 
going O 
to O 
happen. O 
I O 
mean, O 
not O 
the O 
way O 
-- O 
-- O 
not O 
the O 
way O 
they'll O 
-- O 
-- O 
not O 
like O 
it O 
is O 
here. O 
And O 
I O 
agree O 
that O 
we O 
shouldn't O 
send O 
people O 
over O 
there. O 
We've O 
got O 
enough O 
stuff O 
going O 
on O 
with O 
Roger O 
Yeah. O 
Barb O 
Iraq O 
and O 
I- O 
and, O 
um, O 
the O 
-- O 
other O 
-- O 
-- O 
the O 
other O 
guy. O 
Roger O 
Yeah. O 
Barb O 
We O 
got O 
way O 
too O 
much O 
going O 
and O 
too O 
much O 
expense, O 
I O 
mean, O 
we O 
we O 
can't, O 
the O 
that's O 
Roger O 
Yeah. O 
Barb O 
that O 
would O 
be O 
just O 
putting O 
it O 
over O 
the O 
edge O 
right O 
there. O 
But O 
I O 
think O 
ought O 
support, O 
you O 
know, O 
a O 
man O 
that, O 
Roger O 
Mhm. O 
Barb O 
like O 
you O 
said, O 
is O 
-- O 
would O 
like O 
to O 
coexist O 
-- O 
with O 
everybody O 
and O 
somebody O 
that O 
is O 
Roger O 
Yeah. O 
Barb O 
peaceful O 
-- O 
and, O 
I O 
don't O 
know, O 
I'd O 
like O 
to O 
learn O 
more O 
about O 
the O 
Bible. O 
My O 
parents O 
never O 
took O 
me O 
to O 
church O 
or O 
anything. O 
But, O 
um, O 
Roger O 
Yeah. O 
Barb O 
I'd O 
like O 
to O 
-- O 
I O 
know O 
that, O 
you O 
know, O 
there's O 
been O 
problems, O 
a O 
lot O 
of O 
conflict O 
over O 
there, O 
and O 
it O 
seems O 
like O 
no O 
matter O 
what, O 
Roger O 
Ah. O 
Barb O 
just O 
like O 
Iraq O 
ye- O 
eh, O 
we O 
try O 
to O 
go O 
in O 
and O 
get O 
peace O 
and- O 
and O 
how O 
long O 
has O 
it O 
been O 
and, O 
I O 
mean, O 
I O 
think O 
Saddam PER
needed O 
to O 
be O 
removed O 
but O 
it's- O 
-- O 
there's O 
just O 
-- O 
s- O 
all O 
these O 
people O 
that O 
are O 
going O 
to O 
follow O 
him O 
no O 
matter O 
what. O 
Roger O 
Yeah, O 
and, O 
um, O 
I O 
only O 
know O 
about O 
Yasser PER
Arafat PER
because O 
I, O 
um, O 
study O 
international O

a O 
little O 
bit O 
-- O 
and O 
I O 
know O 
-- O 
a O 
very O 
little O 
bit O 
about O 
him O 
because, O 
of O 
course O 
he O 
was O 
a, O 
um, O 
leader O 
for O 
a O 
long O 
time, O 
longer O 
than O 
the O 
age O 
that O 
I O 
am O 
-- O 
old, O 
so, O 
but O 
I- O 
I- O 
I- O 
I've O 
noticed O 
-- O 
on O 
throughout O 
my O 
studies O 
that O 
-- O 
what O 
he O 
represented O 
to O 
the O 
public O 
-- O 
was O 
-- O 
what O 
he O 
represented O 
to O 
the O 
international O 
public O 
-- O 
was O 
not O 
what O 
he O 
was O 
representing O 
to O 
his O 
people O 
-- O 
and O 
he O 
was O 
representing, O 
um, O 
peace O 
with O 
the O 
Israelis O 
and O 
he O 
was O 
representing O 
trying O 
to O 
find O 
((the O 
whites O 
or)) O 
divide O 
the O 
land O 
so O 
that O 
it O 
would O 
be, O 
um, O 
stop, O 
um, O 
uh, O 
war O 
and O 
terrorists O 
in O 
the O 
area. O 
But O 
I O 
don't O 
think O 
that O 
he O 
had O 
the O 
same O 
image O 
to- O 
to O 
his O 
people. O 
I O 
think O 
that O 
it O 
was O 
a O 
front O 
-- O 
for O 
him O 
to O 
allow O 
to O 
to O 
be O 
accepted O 
in O 
an O 
international O 
community, O 
but O 
I O 
think O 
-- O 
that O 
his O 
ultimate O 
plans O 
and O 
goals O 
were O 
to O 
to O 
run O 
the O 
Israelis O 
out O 
-- O 
maybe O 
closer O 
to O 
the O 
Gaza LOC

and O 
to O 
re-take O 
Jerusalem O

and O 
other O

to, O 
uh, O 
uplift O

-- O 
they O 
could O 
say, O 
you O

It's O 
a O 
matter O 
of, O 
uh O 
-- O 
I O

it's O 
more O 
than O

Arab PER
and O 
Israel O 
because O 
there O 
is O 
-- O 
-- O 
there O 
are O 
a O 
lot O 
of, O 
uh, O 
decisions O 
have O 
been O 
made O 
-- O 
have O 
been O 
made O 
-- O 
and O 
this, O 
uh- O 
For O 
example, O 
one O 
of O 
them O 
was, O 
uh, O 
decision O 
number O 
two O 
forty-two O 
-- O 
and O 
this O 
was O 
about O 
-- O 
the O 
ha- O 
establishing O 
two- O 
two O 
countries, O 
one O 
for O 
Israel O 
and O 
another O 
one O 
for O

So, O 
if O 
we O 
-- O 
-- O 
eh, O 
if O 
United O 
States, O 
Bush, PER
Israel O 
((told)) O 
th- O 
the O 
solution O 
or O 
to, O 
uh, O 
to O 
make O 
the O 
decision, O 
eh, O 
I O 
think O 
this O 
will O 
solve O 
-- O 
the O 
problem. O 
The O 
-- O 
unfortunately O 
what O 
happens O 
right O 
now- O 
-- O 
The O 
-- O 
for O 
example, O 
which O 
is O 
-- O 
little O 
bit O 
toward O 
it's- O 
it's O 
interest. O 
For O 
example, O 
when O 
there O 
was, O 
uh, O 
like, O 
a O 
-- O 
decision O 
against O 
Iraq, O 
the O 
United O 
States O 
-- O 
went O 
directly O 
-- O 
to O 
Iraq O 
to O 
-- O 
-- O 
for, O 
eh, O 
uh, O 
an O 
invasion O 
-- O 
and O 
-- O 
for O 
-- O 
whatever O 
reasons- O 
-- O 
she O 
even O 
was O 
out, O 
uh, O 
putting O 
any O 
attention O 
to O 
the O 
United ORG
Nations, ORG
uh, O 
like, O 
uh, O 
approval. O 
She O 
did O 
wha- O 
what O 
she O 
want. O 
But, O 
eh, O 
eh, O 
for O 
Israeli, O 
Palestinian O 
conflict O 
there's O 
a O 
lot O 
of O 
decisions O 
that O 
has O 
to O 
be O 
-- O 
applied O 
but O 
until O 
now O 
-- O 
she O 
didn't O 
put O 
any O 
pressure, O 
eh, O 
toward O 
((this O 
and)) O 
and O 
I O 
believe O 
this O 
policy O 
has O 
been, O 
uh, O 
this O 
kind O 
of O 
policy, O 
eh, O 
um, O 
eh, O 
became O 
more O 
and O 
more O 
during O 
-- O 
eh, O 
during, O 
uh, O 
eh, O 
Bush PER
-- O 
-- O 
President O 
Bush PER
time. O 
For O 
example, O 
before, O 
eh, O 
during O 
Clinton, PER
I O 
believe O 
at O 
that O 
time O 
-- O 
Clinton PER
was O 
trying O 
hard O 
-- O 
to O 
solve O 
this O 
problem O 
and O 
I O 
believe O 
at O 
that O 
time, O 
if O 
you O 
remember, O 
um, O 
Yasser PER
Arafat PER
-- O 
and, O 
uh, O 
the O 
prime O 
minister O 
of O 
Israel, O 
his O 
name O 
was O 
Barak, PER
they O 
met O 
together O 
in O 
the O 
White O 
House O 
-- O 
and O 
-- O 
they O 
almost O 
came O 
to O 
an O 
agreement O 
-- O 
to O 
solve O 
this O 
problem O 
-- O 
and O 
during O 
Clinton, PER
eh, O 
period O 
-- O 
they O 
had, O 
uh, O 
this O 
((Oslo)) O 
a- O 
eh, O 
agreement. O 
Most O 
of O 
the O 
big O 
problems O 
between O 
the O 
two O 
parties, O 
they O 
negotiated O 
everything O 
almost O 
and O 
there O 
is O 
-- O 
there O 
were, O 
like, O 
final O 
steps O 
that O 
have O 
to O 
be O 
solved. O 
But, O 
uh, O 
I O 
think O 
if O 
there O 
was, O 
like, O 
the, O 
um, O 
the O 
same O 
policy O 
has O 
to O 
be O 
followed O 
after O 
Clinton. PER
I O 
think O 
-- O 
everything O 
would- O 
-- O 
-finished O 
then- O 
-- O 
the O 
-- O 
I O 
think O 
United O 
States O 
-- O 
went O 
to O 
another O 
direction O 
and, O 
eh, O 
they O 
forgot O 
about O 
this O 
problem O 
right O 
now. O 
Mark PER
Yeah, O 
I O 
g- O 
eh, O 
see, O 
I O 
don't, O 
Ali PER

um, O 
when- O 
when O 
policy O 
is O 
set O 
by O 
one O 
-- O 
-- O 
by O 
one O 
president O 
-- O 
towards- O 
towards O 
one O 
thing, O 
it's O 
usually O 
-- O 
followed O 
through, O 
if O 
there O 
is O 
something O 
to O 
follow O 
through, O 
by O 
the O 
-- O 
next O 
president O 
in O 
turn. O 
He O 
is O 
more O 
or O 
less O 
obligated O 
-- O 
to O 
continue, O 
uh, O 
the O 
process O 
that O 
was O 
already O 
started O 
-- O 
but O 
-- O 
I O 
think O 
-- O 
Bush's PER
-- O 
agenda O 
-- O 
is O 
not O 
-- O 
towards O 
that O 
right O 
now. O 
That O 
is O 
not O 
his O 
priority, O 
I O 
don't O

Ali PER

I O

so, O 
yes. O

eh, O 
uh, O 
although, O 
you O

it's O

y- O

in O 
the O

the- O

that- O

the O

the O

All O 
right. O 
Uh, O 
what O 
do O 
you O

about O 
this O

I O 
don't O

it, O 
to O

you. O 
Winnette PER
Oh O 
this O 
is O 
funny O 
because O 
I O 
just, O 
one O 
of O 
my O 
calls O 
the O 
other O 
day O 
was O 
regarding O 
this. O 
Irvin PER
Really? O 
Winnette PER
So O 
uh O 
uh O 
they're O 
act- O 
-- O 
actually O 
that's O 
getting O 
a O 
few O 
different O 
questions O 
and O 
-- O 
actually O 
the O 
gentleman O 
I O 
got O 
the O 
other O 
day O 
-- O 
hadn't O 
even O 
heard O 
about O 
it. O 
Um, O 
Irvin PER
Oh O 
really? O 
Winnette PER
Well O 
um, O 
I've O 
been O 
following O 
it O 
pretty O 
closely. O 
Um, O 
I O 
guess O 
because O 
of O 
-- O 
you O 
know O 
it O 
being O 
a O 
mother O 
and O 
-- O 
being O 
pregnant O 
for O 
a O 
baby. O 
Irvin PER
Oh, O 
uh-huh. O 
Winnette PER
Um, O 
kind O 
of O 
hit O 
more O 
to O 
-- O 
I O 
you O 
know O 
to O 
home. O 
Um, O 
So O 
you O 
-- O 
how O 
much O 
of O 
it O 
have O 
you O 
followed? O 
Did, O 
did O 
you O 
-- O 
follow O 
any O 
of O 
it O 
at O 
all O 
when O 
it O 
was O 
on O 
in O 
the O 
news O 
or O 
in O 
the O 
papers O 
or O 
anything? O 
Irvin PER
Hardly O 
any O 
of O 
it O 
at O 
all, O 
because O 
-- O 
um O 
-- O 
for O 
one O 
thing O 
-- O 
I O 
do O 
not O 
have O 
a O 
~TV O 
or O 
a O 
radio O 
and O 
I O 
don't O 
get O 
a O 
daily O 
newspaper. O 
We O 
get O 
Winnette PER
Oh O 
wow. O 
Irvin PER
we O 
get O 
a O 
weekly O 
newspaper. O 
Winnette PER
Okay. O 
Um, O 
well O 
I'll O 
I O 
don't O 
get O 
any O 
newspapers O 
at O 
the O 
house, O 
but O 
-- O 
I O 
listen O 
to O 
the O 
radio O 
every O 
morning O 
on O 
my O 
way O 
to O 
work O 
and O 
Irvin PER
Oh O 
yeah? O 
Winnette PER
and O 
uh O 
-- O 
when O 
it O 
first O 
happened O 
it O 
was O 
-- O 
pretty O 
publicized O 
on O 
every O 
radio O 
station O 
um O 
-- O 
it O 
come O 
across O 
-- O 
on O 
the O 
news O 
and O 
we O 
keep O 
our O 
~TV O 
on O 
at O 
my O 
work, O 
because O 
we O 
have O 
a O 
customer O 
waiting O 
area, O 
so O 
Irvin PER
Oh, O 
uh-huh. O 
Winnette PER
um O 
actually O 
one O 
of O 
our O 
employees O 
had O 
wa- O 
watched O 
((happening)) O 
-- O 
so O 
from O 
that O 
point O 
on O 
we O 
kind O 
of O 
-- O 
talked O 
a O 
lot O 
about O 
it O 
at O 
work O 
and O 
Irvin PER
How O 
long O 
ago O 
was O 
it? O 
Winnette PER
different O 
things. O 
Um, O 
it O 
was O 
a O 
year O 
-- O 
almost O 
a O 
year O 
ago. O 
Over O 
a O 
year O 
ago? O 
Because O 
it O 
was O 
just O 
before O 
Christmas O 
-- O 
that O 
it O 
happened. O 
Irvin PER
Over O 
a O 
year O 
ago. O 
Winnette PER
Yeah. O 
Um, O 
I'm O 
thinking O 
-- O 
I O 
don't O 
know, O 
November, O 
December, O 
I'm O 
not O 
sure O 
exactly. O 
But O 
I O 
know O 
it O 
was O 
just O 
before O 
Christmas O 
-- O 
when O 
they O 
had O 
uh O 
-- O 
it O 
had O 
happened, O 
because O 
she O 
was O 
missing O 
during O 
Christmas O 
and O 
then O 
they O 
had O 
found O 
her O 
body. O 
And O 
they O 
-- O 
they O 
found O 
the O 
baby O 
as O 
well. O 
Irvin PER
Terrible. O 
Winnette PER
Um, O 
so O 
when O 
they O 
found O 
the O 
baby, O 
the O 
baby O 
of O 
course O 
had O 
been O 
-- O 
they O 
don't O 
know O 
if O 
the O 
baby O 
was O 
born, O 
through O 
delivery, O 
or O 
-- O 
if O 
maybe O 
from O 
um O 
-- O 
the O 
corpse O 
I O 
guess O 
Irvin PER
So O 
the O 
baby O 
was O 
separate. O 
Winnette PER
maybe O 
extracted O 
it. O 
Um, O 
actually O 
she O 
was O 
pregnant O 
for O 
the O 
baby. O 
Irvin PER
But O 
the O 
baby O 
was O 
separate O 
from O 
the O 
body O 
when O 
he O 
found O 
it? O 
Winnette PER
Yes. O 
Yep. O 
Um, O 
I O 
don't O 
know O 
if O 
ma- O 
I O 
you O 
know O 
I O 
don't O 
know O 
the O 
whole O 
story O 
for O 
sure, O 
but O 
-- O 
um O 
-- O 
he O 
had O 
-- O 
you O 
know, O 
obviously O 
-- O 
denied O 
that O 
he O 
was O 
involved O 
anything O 
to O 
do O 
with O 
it. O 
Then O 
they O 
found O 
out O 
that O 
he O 
was O 
having O 
an O 
affair O 
on O 
her. O 
And O 
-- O 
then O 
of O 
course O 
when O 
they O 
were O 
investigating O 
him O 
-- O 
he O 
tried O 
running. O 
Dyed O 
his O 
hair O 
and O 
-- O 
grew O 
out O 
a O 
mustache O 
and O 
-- O 
they O 
caught O 
him O 
trying O 
to O 
run O 
with O 
-- O 
quite O 
a O 
bit O 
of O 
cash. O 
Irvin PER
Wow. O 
Winnette PER
So O 
I O 
mean, O 
Irvin PER
(()) O 
Winnette PER
he's O 
-- O 
in O 
all O 
honesty O 
been O 
guilty O 
all O 
along O 
the O 
way O 
but O 
Irvin PER
Uh-huh. O 
Winnette PER
of O 
course O 
you O 
know O 
they've O 
got O 
to O 
give O 
him O 
that O 
reasonable O 
doubt. O 
Irvin PER
Uh-huh. O 
So O 
is O 
he O 
is O 
he O 
still O 
um O 
-- O 
in O 
prison O 
now? O 
Winnette PER
Yeah. O 
And O 
they're O 
making O 
the O 
determination O 
if O 
-- O 
in O 
fact O 
he O 
will O 
get O 
the O 
death O 
penalty, O 
or O 
life O 
in O 
prison. O 
So O 
that's O 
what's O 
is O 
up O 
in O 
the O 
air O 
right O 
now. O 
Irvin PER
What O 
state O 
is O 
this O 
in? O 
Winnette PER
California. O 
Irvin PER
It's O 
in O 
California. O 
Winnette PER
And O 
-- O 
um O 
-- O 
I O 
know O 
I O 
had, O 
it O 
was O 
supposed O 
to O 
have O 
be O 
deliberated O 
on O 
-- O 
the O 
twenty-second O 
of O 
November, O 
but O 
they O 
had O 
an O 
issue O 
happen O 
with O 
-- O 
one O 
of O 
the O 
jurors O 
-- O 
so O 
it's O 
postponed O 
everything. O 
But, O 
actually O 
they O 
were O 
trying O 
to O 
pass O 
a O 
law, O 
and O 
I O 
don't O 
know O 
if O 
it O 
ever O 
did O 
take O 
into O 
effect, O 
that O 
if O 
in O 
fact O 
a O 
mother O 
was O 
killed, O 
and O 
pregnant, O 
um O 
-- O 
for O 
there O 
to O 
be O 
a O 
double O 
murder O 
charge. O 
Irvin PER
Oh, O 
uh-huh. O 
Winnette PER
And O 
-- O 
they O 
were O 
in O 
fact O 
trying O 
to O 
enforce O 
the O 
death O 
penalty O 
on O 
that O 
charge O 
if O 
they O 
were O 
-- O 
found O 
guilty O 
on O 
both O 
charges. O 
Irvin PER
Uh-huh. O 
Winnette PER
And O 
-- O 
so O 
it's O 
kind O 
of O 
up O 
in O 
the O 
air O 
now O 
-- O 
because O 
he O 
-- O 
I O 
believe O 
he O 
got O 
first O 
degree O 
murder O 
and O 
-- O 
um O 
and O 
then O 
got O 
manslaughter O 
on O 
the O 
baby. O 
So O 
he O 
didn't O 
get O 
both O 
first O 
degree O 
murders. O 
Irvin PER
What's O 
the O 
difference? O 
Winnette PER
Where O 
-- O 
Um, O 
I O 
guess O 
because O 
he O 
didn't O 
murder O 
the O 
baby O 
directly. O 
Irvin PER
Oh. O 
Winnette PER
I'm O 
thinking O 
maybe O 
was O 
the O 
difference. O 
And O 
because O 
of O 
the O 
the O 
charge O 
on O 
the O 
baby, O 
they O 
couldn't O 
automatically O 
give O 
him O 
the O 
death O 
penalty, O 
but O 
-- O 
obviously O 
there's O 
enough O 
-- O 
um, O 
complaints O 
or O 
whatever O 
Irvin PER
What O 
was O 
his O 
excuse O 
for O 
doing O 
something O 
horrible O 
like O 
that? O 
Winnette PER
and O 
-- O 
well O 
he O 
still O 
denies O 
everything. O 
He O 
has O 
never O 
admitted O 
Irvin PER
((Still O 
does)) O 
Winnette PER
to O 
do O 
it. O 
um O 
-- O 
But O 
the O 
only O 
thing O 
they O 
can O 
figure O 
is O 
that O 
maybe O 
-- O 
he O 
wanted O 
back O 
into O 
the O 
bachelor O 
life, O 
and O 
didn't O 
want O 
to O 
be O 
a O 
father, O 
didn't O 
want O 
to O 
be O 
tied O 
down O 
with O 
a O 
wife O 
and O 
child O 
Irvin PER
So O 
he O 
didn't O 
have O 
any O 
other O 
children? O 
Winnette PER
that O 
was O 
-- O 
No, O 
that O 
was O 
going O 
to O 
be O 
their O 
first. O 
And O 
actually O 
I O 
don't O 
even O 
think O 
they O 
were O 
married O 
that O 
long, O 
maybe O 
a O 
year O 
or O 
two. O

Hey, O

a O

Oh O

Obo O

okay. O 
Obo O 
I O

I O 
I O 
don't O

the O 
main O

Ted O 
Uh-huh. O 
Obo O 
ever, O 
I O 
usually O 
try O 
to O 
stay O 
out O 
of O 
the O 
main O 
party, O 
because O 
I O 
think, O 
and O 
this O 
last O 
election O 
showed O 
that O 
both O 
are O 
very O 
brutal. O 
Ted O 
It O 
was O 
Obo O 
Um, O 
yeah O 
I O 
think O 
that O 
the, O 
uh O 
Ted O 
election. O 
Obo O 
Oh, O 
I'm O 
sorry. O 
Ted O 
It O 
was O 
a O 
very O 
brutal O 
election. O 
Obo O 
Yeah, O 
yeah, O 
it's, O 
yeah, O 
you're O 
absolutely, O 
yeah, O 
and O 
I'm O 
sorry, O 
I O 
mean, O 
if O 
you O 
want O 
to O 
add O 
anything O 
I'm O 
sorry. O 
Ted O 
No O 
no, O 
go O 
ahead, O 
go O 
ahead. O 
Obo O 
And, O 
ah O 
-- O 
It's, O 
it's O 
just O 
that O 
-- O 
Like, O 
I O 
I O 
just, O 
I O 
think O 
that O 
the O 
last O 
fifty O 
years, O 
the O 
government O 
has O 
been O 
mes- O 
messed O 
up O 
by O 
both O 
these O 
parties, O 
honestly. O 
Even O 
maybe O 
before O 
that. O 
So, O 
I, O 
I O 
usually O 
do O 
third O 
party O 
-- O 
um, O 
and O 
the O 
way O 
it O 
was O 
working O 
this O 
year O 
was O 
that O 
the O 
Democrats PER
really O 
pushed O 
to O 
get O 
Ralph PER
Nader PER
off O 
the O 
ballot O 
Ted O 
Yeah. O 
Yeah O 
they O 
did. O 
Obo O 
in O 
every O 
state, O 
and O 
um O 
-- O 
I O 
mean, O 
the O 
Republicans PER
sort O 
of O 
tried O 
to O 
play O 
like O 
they O 
were O 
helping O 
him O 
out, O 
but O 
they O 
knew O 
they O 
they O 
didn't O 
really O 
have O 
to O 
because O 
they O 
knew O 
the O 
Democrats PER
were O 
already O 
doing O 
more O 
damage O 
to O 
keep O 
him O 
off O 
the O 
ballot O 
and O 
they O 
were O 
successful, O 
and O 
for O 
a O 
progressive O 
party O 
that O 
was O 
very O 
brutal. O 
Ted O 
Mhm, O 
it O 
was. O 
Obo O 
And O 
I O 
wasn't O 
really O 
impressed O 
by O 
either O 
of O 
the O 
two O 
vice O 
presidential O 
candidates, O 
I O 
know O 
Dick PER
Cheney PER
seems O 
to O 
be O 
running O 
the O 
show O 
Ted O 
You O 
know? O 
Obo O 
and, O 
ah O 
-- O 
I O 
mean, O 
and, O 
and O 
a O 
lot O 
of O 
it O 
has O 
to O 
do O 
-- O 
and O 
then, O 
I O 
just O 
didn't O 
know O 
much, O 
John PER
Edwards PER
seemed O 
nice, O 
but O 
he O 
just, O 
you O 
know, O 
he O 
was O 
just, O 
he O 
just O 
got O 
elected O 
to O 
the O 
Senate, ORG
and, O 
I O 
wasn't O 
really O 
familiar O 
too O 
much O 
with O 
hi- O 
I O 
mean, O 
I O 
think O 
it's O 
great O 
that O 
he O 
got O 
into O 
the O 
vice O 
presidential O 
role, O 
but O 
-- O 
again, O 
it's O 
the O 
whole O 
parties O 
that O 
I'm O 
really O 
not O 
really O 
I O 
don't O 
like O 
their O 
policies. O 
Ted O 
Well, O 
you O 
kind O 
of O 
hit O 
on O 
some O 
of O 
my O 
sentiments, O 
um, O 
I'm O 
a O 
fifty-year- O 
old O 
black O 
male, O 
and O 
this O 
was O 
my O 
first O 
election O 
that O 
I O 
participated O 
in. O 
And O 
the O 
reason O 
was O 
was O 
that, O 
ah, O 
I'm O 
retired O 
Air ORG
Force ORG
-- O 
and O 
before, O 
ah, O 
because O 
I O 
was O 
in O 
the O 
military O 
-- O 
ah, O 
didn't O 
didn't O 
really O 
think O 
that O 
my O 
vote, O 
um, O 
counted O 
one O 
way O 
or O 
the O 
other, O 
that's O 
that O 
was O 
my O 
thinking. O 
You O 
know, O 
I O 
had O 
a O 
role O 
to O 
fulfill O 
and O 
regardless O 
of O 
how O 
I O 
voted, O 
uh, O 
I O 
was O 
going O 
to O 
have O 
to O 
fulfill O 
that O 
role. O 
Um, O 
Obo O 
Yeah. O 
Ted O 
the, O 
the O 
situation, O 
though, O 
now O 
that O 
I'm O 
out O 
and, O 
in O 
the O 
civilian O 
sector, O 
um, O 
I O 
find O 
that O 
the O 
economics O 
as O 
far O 
as O 
home O 
-- O 
is O 
what O 
I'm O 
most O 
concerned O 
with. O 
And O 
because O 
of O 
the O 
economic O 
situation, O 
I O 
don't O 
think O 
that's O 
being O 
addressed. O 
Yes, O 
I O 
feel O 
very, O 
very O 
bad O 
in O 
regards O 
to O 
the, O 
ah, O 
nine-eleven O 
tragedy O 
and O 
terrorism O 
and O 
this O 
kind O 
of O 
stuff O 
Obo O 
Mhm. O 
Ted O 
um, O 
but O 
I O 
think O 
so O 
much O 
attention O 
is O 
being O 
paid O 
to O 
that O 
-- O 
that O 
-- O 
as O 
you O 
mentioned, O 
over O 
the O 
past O 
fifty O 
years, O 
the O 
two O 
parties O 
that O 
run O 
the O 
country O 
-- O 
um, O 
have O 
definitely O 
taken O 
a, O 
um O 
-- O 
streamlined O 
approach O 
to O 
whatever O 
their O 
agenda O 
may O 
be O 
and O 
not O 
the O 
will O 
of O 
the O 
people. O 
Obo O 
You O 
said O 
it O 
very O 
well. O 
I O 
totally, O 
you O 
coul- O 
I O 
couldn't O 
have O 
said O 
it O 
better. O 
Ted O 
Now O 
it's O 
uh O 
-- O 
and O 
as O 
time O 
goes O 
on, O 
you O 
know, O 
like, O 
ah, O 
what O 
are O 
we, O 
you O 
know, O 
headed O 
for, O 
what O 
are O 
we O 
faced O 
with? O 
Obo O 
I O 
I O 
Ted O 
I O 
mean, O 
if O 
we O 
don't O 
start O 
looking O 
inward O 
and O 
start O 
taking O 
care O 
of O 
things O 
at O

uh, O 
right O 
now, O 
yeah, O 
we O 
are O

I O 
heard O 
a O 
commentary O

Rush PER
Limbaugh, PER
ah, O 
the O 
other O 
day, O 
and O 
the O 
comment O 
was O 
made O 
was O 
that O 
there O 
always O 
is O 
going O 
to O 
be O 
a O 
big O 
dog O 
on O 
the O 
street. O 
And O 
right O 
now O 
I'm O 
proud O 
to O 
be, O 
ah, O 
you O 
know, O 
behind O 
the O 
big O 
dog, O 
meaning O 
the O 
United O

If O 
i- O 
if O 
if O 
-- O 
the O 
United O 
States O 
is O 
not O 
the O 
big O 
dog, O 
some O 
power O 
in O 
the O 
world O 
is O 
going O 
to O 
step O 
up O 
and O 
be O 
just O 
that. O 
We O 
got O 
so O 
many O

uh O 
what O

you O

hot O

uh, O 
instead O

got, O 
uh, O 
what O 
is O 
it, O 
Iran? O 
Uh, O 
right O 
behind O 
Iraq O 
there. O 
And O 
then O 
North O 
Korea, O 
which O 
is, O 
you O 
know, O 
always O 
volatile. O 
Uh, O 
you O 
know, O 
those O 
situations O 
are O 
not O 
getting O 
any O

voting, O 
but O 
-- O 
sometimes O 
I O 
wonder. O 
John PER
Right. O 
Right. O 
Wasn't, O 
uh, O 
Wisconsin O 
was O 
like O 
a O 
swing, O 
er, O 
uh, O 
they O 
were O 
really O 
pu- O 
or O 
no O 
it O 
was O 
Ohio, O 
I O 
think, O 
was O 
the O 
really, O 
uh, O 
Ivan PER
Yeah, O 
Ohio O 
was O 
th- O 
the O 
big O 
swing O 
one. O 
It O 
was O 
John PER
big O 
upset. O 
Right. O 
Ivan PER
fairly O 
close O 
here, O 
John PER
It O 
was, O 
yeah. O 
Ivan PER
uh, O 
uh, O 
it O 
was, O 
uh, O 
it O 
went, O 
uh, O 
what O 
color O 
was O 
it? O 
Blue O 
I O 
guess O 
it O 
was. O 
John PER
Right. O 
Ivan PER
And, O 
uh, O 
John PER
My O 
-- O 
uh-huh. O 
Ivan PER
yeah, O 
go O 
ahead. O 
John PER
Well, O 
my O 
parents O 
live O 
back O 
there O 
still. O 
Ivan PER
Uh-huh. O 
John PER
In O 
fact, O 
we O 
just O 
got O 
back O 
from O 
Disney O 
World, O 
you O 
know, O 
about O 
an O 
hour O 
ago O 
and O 
they're O 
down O 
there O 
and O 
they're O 
but O 
they're O 
both, O 
uh, O 
Ivan PER
Oh. O 
John PER
one's O 
one O 
and O 
one's O 
the O 
other O 
Ivan PER
Uh-huh. O 
John PER
so O 
they O 
arg- O 
you O 
know, O 
they O 
just O 
go O 
and O 
vote O 
and O 
cancel O 
each O 
other O 
out, O 
you O 
know. O 
Ivan PER
Yeah, O 
uh-huh. O 
Yeah. O 
Yeah. O 
John PER
And, O 
uh, O 
kind O 
of O 
funny, O 
so. O 
Um, O 
I O 
don't O 
know. O 
I O 
guess O 
we'll O 
just O 
have O 
to O 
see O 
what O 
happens O 
with, O 
uh, O 
Mr. O 
Bush. PER
Hopefully O 
it's O 
-- O 
good O 
choice, O 
you O 
know, O 
Ivan PER
Mhm. O 
John PER
I O 
don't O 
know. O 
Ivan PER
Wow, O 
you O 
really- O 
John PER
I O 
di- O 
I O 
didn't O 
have O 
a O 
lot O 
of O 
faith O 
in O 
any O 
of O 
them, O 
really, O 
Ivan PER
nah. O 
John PER
er, O 
I O 
mean, O 
I O 
-- O 
I O 
didn't O 
really O 
know O 
what O 
was O 
the O 
perfect O 
choice. O 
Ivan PER
No, O 
they're, O 
ah, O 
I O 
can't O 
ever O 
remember O 
a O 
perfect O 
choice O 
and O 
I've O 
been O 
voting O 
since, O 
uh, O 
Nixon PER
McGovern, PER
uh, O 
so O 
John PER
Right. O 
Ivan PER
I, O 
uh, O 
I'd- O 
I've O 
never O 
-- O 
ever O 
seen O 
a O 
perfect O 
candidate. O 
John PER
Right. O 
Ivan PER
But O 
that's O 
John PER
Yeah. O 
Ivan PER
th- O 
that's O 
to O 
be O 
expected, O 
I O 
mean, O 
you O 
know, O 
they're O 
all O 
human O 
beings. O 
John PER
Can't O 
please O 
everybody. O 
Ivan PER
Yeah. O 
Yep. O 
And, O 
uh, O 
as O 
far O 
as O 
what O 
I O 
thought O 
of O 
the O 
various O 
candidates, O 
uh, O 
you O 
know, O 
I O 
guess O 
we O 
-- O 
said O 
what O 
we O 
said O 
about O 
Bush, PER
but, O 
uh, O 
Kerry, PER
I O 
don't O 
know, O 
it's O 
just O 
that O 
-- O 
-coast, O 
uh, O 
kind O 
of O 
persona O 
or O 
image, O 
-t, O 
uh, O 
I O 
-- O 
don't O 
care O 
for, O 
for O 
one O 
thing. O 
John PER
Uh-huh. O 
Ivan PER
From O 
Massachusetts O 
i- O 
-- O 
-candidate. O 
John PER
Right. O 
Ivan PER
And, O 
uh, O 
Cheney PER
-- O 
which O 
he's O 
kind O 
of O 
out O 
your O 
way, O 
uh, O 
Wyoming. O 
John PER
Uh-huh. O 
Ivan PER
Uh, O 
uh, O 
he's O 
kind O 
of O 
a O 
non-descript O 
person, O 
as O 
far O 
as, O 
like O 
I O 
I'm O 
sure O 
he's O 
he's O 
probably O 
a O 
nice O 
guy, O 
and O 
-- O 
a O 
lot O 
of O 
fun O 
at O 
a O 
party O 
probably, O 
I O 
don't O 
know, O 
but, O 
you O 
know, O 
just O 
from O 
-- O 
what O 
you O 
see O 
of O 
him, O 
he's O 
just O 
kind O 
of O 
-- O 
kind O 
of O 
like O 
an O 
old O 
grandpa, O 
you O 
know. O 
John PER
Yeah, O 
he's O 
real O 
grouchy. O 
Ivan PER
Yeah, O 
he O 
just O 
John PER
In O 
those O 
debates O 
he O 
was O 
like O 
a O 
pitbull. O 
Ivan PER
Yeah, O 
yeah. O 
John PER
You O 
know, O 
he O 
would O 
c- O 
him O 
and, O 
uh, O 
I O 
mean, O 
uh, O 
I O 
don't O 
know, O 
he O 
he O 
kind O 
of O 
picked O 
apart O 
Edwards PER
Ivan PER
Mhm. O 
John PER
and, O 
um, O 
but O 
then O 
-- O 
Edwards PER
fought O 
back O 
kind O 
of O 
-- O 
you O 
know O 
and O 
then O 
all O 
the O 
stuff O 
you O 
hear O 
about O 
Edwards PER
too, O 
about O 
the, O 
uh, O 
how O 
he's O 
a O 
trial O 
lawyer O 
and O 
how O 
he O 
made O 
all O 
his O 
millions O 
-- O 
suing O 
insurance O 
companies O 
and, O 
um, O 
you O 
know, O 
there- O 
there's O 
-- O 
bad O 
stuff O 
you O 
hear O 
about O 
both O 
of O 
them O 
that, O 
you O 
know, O 
obviously O 
they O 
want O 
to O 
tell O 
you O 
Ivan PER
Yeah. O 
Yeah. O 
John PER
that O 
I O 
didn't O 
like. O 
And, O 
I O 
guess O 
I O 
didn't O 
really O 
like O 
that, O 
uh, O 
uh, O 
Kerry PER
was, O 
like, O 
changing O 
his O 
story O 
all O 
the O 
time, O 
like, O 
oh, O 
I- O 
-- O 
I O 
believe O 
in O 
this O 
but, O 
uh, O 
no O 
I O 
don't O 
but O 
yes O 
I O 
do O 
and, O 
Ivan PER
Yeah. O 
John PER
you O 
know. O 
I'm O 
kind O 
of O 
a O 
cut O 
and O 
dry O 
kind O 
of O 
a O 
guy. O 
Ivan PER
Yeah. O 
John PER
If O 
you O 
got O 
an O 
opinion O 
I'd O 
rather O 
just O 
want O 
you O 
to O 
tell O 
me O 
straight O 
up O 
and O 
not O 
Ivan PER
Yeah. O 
John PER
try O 
to O 
beat O 
around O 
the O 
bush O 
to O 
-- O 
get O 
my O 
vote O 
or O 
something O 
like O 
that. O 
Ivan PER
Yeah, O 
yeah. O 
Yeah, O 
I O 
guess O 
to O 
a O 
certain O 
degree O 
they O 
-- O 
they, O 
uh, O 
I O 
guess O 
try O 
to O 
play O 
to O 
the O 
middle O 
and O 
try O 
to O 
-- O 
please O 
as O 
many O 
people O 
as O 
they O 
can O 
but O 
Kerry PER
was O 
just O 
all O 
over O 
the O 
map. O

What O 
did O 
you O 
think O 
of O 
the O 
two O 
candidates, O 
George PER
Bush PER
and O 
John PER

What O 
about O 
the O 
Vice O

candidates, O 
Dick PER

and O 
John PER
Edwards? PER
What O 
issues O 
were O 
most O 
important O 
to O 
you O 
in O 
deciding O 
who O 
to O 
vote O

If O

Derek PER
from O 
Austin, O 
Texas. O 
Marco PER
Oh. O 
Dan, O 
did O 
you O 
say? O 
Derek PER
Derek. O 
Marco PER
Derek. O 
Derek PER
Yeah. O 
Marco PER
Hi, O 
nice O 
to O 
meet O 
you. O 
Derek PER
Yeah, O 
you O 
too. O 
Marco PER
Um O 
Derek PER
How's O 
it O 
going? O 
Marco PER
Good, O 
good. O 
So, O 
uh O 
the O 
election, O 
um O 
-- O 
the, O 
um O 
-- O 
let's O 
see, O 
overall O 
I O 
felt O 
-- O 
ju- O 
just O 
give O 
you O 
a O 
brief O 
-- O 
summary, O 
I O 
felt O 
-- O 
that O 
-- O 
John PER
Kerry PER
and O 
Edwards PER
were O 
were O 
pretty O 
strong O 
candidates O 
and O 
-- O 
uh O 
-- O 
mm, O 
I O 
don't O 
know, O 
I O 
guess O 
just O 
in O 
terms O 
of O 
policy O 
I O 
didn't O 
-- O 
I O 
didn't, O 
uh, O 
find O 
-- O 
that O 
as O 
compelling O 
as O 
just O 
-- O 
the O 
personality O 
of O 
-- O 
the O 
different O 
candidates. O 
Derek PER
Yeah. O 
Marco PER
felt O 
like O 
I O 
could O 
trust O 
Kerry PER
-- O 
uh, O 
little O 
bit O 
more O 
even O 
though O 
he O 
was O 
much O 
more O 
of O 
a O 
politician O 
than O 
Bush. PER
Derek PER
Mhm. O 
Mhm. O 
Marco PER
Uh, O 
he O 
was O 
-- O 
kind O 
of O 
a O 
smooth O 
talker O 
and O 
Derek PER
Mhm. O 
Marco PER
Um O 
-- O 
uh O 
-- O 
seems O 
like O 
a O 
politician, O 
they O 
way O 
he O 
presented O 
Derek PER
Mhm. O 
Marco PER
his O 
you O 
know O 
his O 
his O 
um O 
argument. O 
But O 
-- O 
uh O 
-- O 
strangely O 
I O 
felt O 
like O 
that O 
what, O 
that O 
was O 
-- O 
one O 
of O 
-- O 
one O 
of O 
his O 
good O 
qualities O 
because O 
I O 
didn't O 
feel O 
Bush PER
was O 
politician O 
enough. O 
That O 
um O 
-- O 
one O 
of O 
the O 
-- O 
issues O 
that O 
I O 
was O 
concerned O 
about O 
was O 
just O 
-- O 
the O 
representation O 
of O 
the O 
United O 
States O 
and O 
-- O 
on O 
the O 
international O 
stage O 
Derek PER
Sure. O 
Marco PER
and O 
I O 
just O 
-- O 
uh O 
-- O 
I O 
uh O 
-- O 
I O 
don't O 
know, O 
uh, O 
Bush PER
is O 
-- O 
the O 
way O 
he O 
presents O 
um O 
-- O 
the O 
~US O 
position O 
-- O 
uh O 
-- O 
seemed O 
a O 
little O 
-- O 
abrasive O 
to O 
me. O 
Derek PER
Mhm. O 
Marco PER
And O 
I O 
-- O 
felt O 
like, O 
hm O 
-- O 
if O 
we're O 
trying O 
to, O 
um O 
-- O 
make O 
-- O 
um O 
-- O 
the O 
United O 
States O 
safer O 
and O 
more O 
stable O 
-- O 
conflict O 
in O 
the O 
world O 
more O 
stable O 
then O 
we O 
probably O 
need O 
somebody O 
-- O 
who O 
is O 
a O 
little O 
bit O 
more O 
-- O 
of O 
a O 
politician O 
in O 
the O 
sense O 
that O 
-- O 
the, O 
they O 
care O 
about O 
diplomacy O 
and O 
-- O 
uh, O 
even O 
though O 
we O 
may O 
not O 
-- O 
give O 
in O 
to O 
-- O 
the O 
will O 
of O 
the O 
other O 
nations O 
present O 
it O 
in O 
a O 
nicer O 
way. O 
Derek PER
Mhm. O 
Marco PER
Yeah, O 
it O 
seems O 
((I O 
make)) O 
kind O 
of O 
simplistic, O 
but O 
-- O 
that O 
was O 
-- O 
an O 
important O 
thing O 
for O 
me. O 
Uh O 
Derek PER
Yeah. O 
Marco PER
Yeah. O 
Derek PER
Um O 
-- O 
I O 
was O 
a O 
little O 
different. O 
I O 
I O 
I O 
agree O 
with O 
everything O 
you O 
said. O 
I O 
just, O 
um O 
-- O 
I O 
come O 
from O 
a O 
little O 
different O 
background O 
as O 
far O 
as O 
being O 
-- O 
I O 
was O 
never O 
into O 
politics O 
and O 
now O 
I O 
I O 
actually O 
have O 
gotten O 
into O 
God PER
much O 
more O 
and O 
and, O 
you O 
know, O 
searching O 
spirituality O 
out. O 
Marco PER
Uh O 
huh. O 
Derek PER
Generally O 
people O 
like O 
that O 
are O 
conservative, O 
you O 
know, O 
Marco PER
Yeah. O 
Derek PER
uh, O 
with O 
their O 
views O 
because O 
of O 
different O 
things O 
like O 
abortion O 
and, O 
and, O 
uh, O 
pro-life O 
and O 
-- O 
all O 
that O 
kind O 
of O 
thing O 
so O 
I O 
came O 
form O 
that O 
background O 
Marco PER
Uh O 
huh. O 
Derek PER
eh, O 
but O 
that O 
was O 
just O 
an O 
added O 
bonus O 
for O 
me O 
in O 
the O 
fact O 
that O 
-- O 
I O 
too O 
was O 
obviously O 
at O 
this O 
point O 
in O 
time O 
concerned O 
about O 
the O 
welfare O 
of O 
our O 
security O 
-- O 
and O 
I O 
felt O 
personally O 
that O 
if O 
-- O 
Kerry PER
was O 
in O 
office O 
we'd O 
kind O 
of O 
be, O 
uh O 
-- O 
up O 
a O 
creek O 
without O 
a O 
paddle O 
because O 
I O 
think O 
-- O 
he O 
is O 
so O 
laid O 
back O 
-- O 
um, O 
and O 
not O 
as O 
aggressive O 
as O 
Bush PER
that O 
at O 
this O 
point O 
in O 
the O 
game, O 
where O 
we're O 
at O 
-- O 
we're O 
in O 
this O 
thing O 
full O 
full O 
-- O 
steam O 
ahead O 
Marco PER
Uh O 
huh. O 
Derek PER
and O 
for O 
a O 
transition O 
to O 
occur O 
at O 
this O 
point O 
-- O 
to O 
someone O 
who O 
is O 
laid O 
back O 
-- O 
and O 
not O 
as O 
aggressive O 
as O 
him O 
I O 
think O 
would O 
actually O 
endanger O 
the O 
~US O 
even O 
more. O 
Marco PER
Yeah. O 
Derek PER
I O 
think O 
that O 
the O 
international, O 
uh O 
uh, O 
leaders O 
would O 
look O 
at O 
Kerry PER
and O 
know, O 
they're O 
very O 
smart, O 
I O 
mean O 
they're O 
-- O 
they're O 
on O 
top O 
of O 
these O 
things, O 
they O 
know, O 
you O 
know, O 
it O 
would O 
, O 
it O 
just O 
would O 
have O 
opened O 
a O 
gateway. O 
Marco PER
Uh O 
huh. O 
Derek PER
I O 
feel O 
Marco PER
Yeah. O 
Derek PER
that, O 
uh, O 
it O 
may O 
have O 
actually O 
put O 
us O 
in O 
more O 
danger. O 
At O 
least O 
Bush PER
has O 
-- O 
pulled O 
out O 
the O 
gun, O 
you O 
know, O 
stick O 
to O 
them, O 
and O 
um O 
-- O 
you O 
know, O 
that's O 
where O 
I O 
was O 
coming O 
from O 
on O 
that. O 
Marco PER
Yeah. O 
Derek PER
And O 
then O 
when O 
I O 
Marco PER
((Do O 
you O 
think)) O 
Derek PER
I O 
listen O 
to O 
a O 
lot O 
of O 
talk O 
radio O 
and O 
when O 
I O 
heard O 
the O 
stuff O 
about O 
Kerry PER
back O 
in O 
the O 
-- O 
the O 
the, O 
apparently O 
the O 
scandals O 
he's O 
pulled O 
as O 
far O 
as O 
the O 
uh, O 
medals O 
when O 
he O 
served O 
time. O 
Marco PER
Uh O 
huh. O 
Derek PER
You O 
know, O 
uh O 
-- O 
I O 
listen O 
to O 
a O 
lot O 
of O 
talk O 
radio O 
and O 
spoke O 
with, O 
you O 
know, O 
heard O 
from O 
a O 
lot O 
of, O 
uh O 
-- O 
veterans O 
-- O 
and O 
they O 
said O 
it O 
was O 
physically, O 
uh, O 
impossible O 
for O 
him O 
to O 
achieve O 
what O 
he O 
said O 
he O 
did. O 
Marco PER
Uh O 
huh. O 
Uh O 
huh. O 
Derek PER
And O 
all O 
the O 
meetings O 
he's O 
missing, O 
and O 
just, O 
you O 
know, O

Marco PER

Derek PER
I O 
think O

more, O 
he O 
got O 
so O 
much O

the O

when O

they O 
were O 
saying O 
that O 
well, O 
another O 
attack O 
on O 
the O 
U.S. O

-- O 
imminent, O 
that O 
it O 
probably O 
-- O 
probably O 
going O 
to O 
happen O 
-- O 
and O 
-- O 
um O 
-- O 
and O 
-- O 
they O 
even O 
went O 
so O 
far O 
to O 
say O 
that O 
if O 
-- O 
it's O 
really O 
difficult O 
to O 
prevent O 
something O 
like O 
this O 
and O 
of O 
course O 
they're O 
doing O 
the O 
best O 
they O 
can O 
and O 
-- O 
I O 
think O 
Kerry PER
would O 
do O 
the O 
best O 
he O 
could. O 
But O 
do O 
you O 
think, O 
um O 
-- O 
that O 
-- O 
and O 
this O 
isn't O 
quite O 
a O 
political O

but O 
do O 
you O

there's O 
going O

like O

-- O 
biblically O

it's O 
inevitable. O 
I O

we're O

And, O

it, O 
the O

let's O

my O 
past O

uh O 
-- O 
illness-wise, O

-- O

from O 
just O 
the O

general O 
point O

it O 
didn't O

he O

sick O 
-- O 
being O

that O

I O

there O 
was O 
something O 
-- O 
you O

malicious O 
done, O 
because, O 
you O

looking O

I O

the O

couldn't O

Ed PER
Right. O 
James PER
Yeah, O 
it, O 
it O 
could've O 
only O 
exacerbated, O 
uh, O 
his O 
situation. O 
Because O 
for O 
-- O 
for O 
a O 
good O 
little O 
while O 
now O 
I've O 
noticed, O 
you O 
know, O 
that O 
his O 
lips O 
would O 
tremble, O 
and O 
Ed PER
Yeah. O 
James PER
and, O 
you O 
know, O 
it's O 
like, O 
um, O 
uh, O 
almost O 
like O 
he O 
had, O 
uh, O 
what O 
is O 
that, O 
Parkinson's? O 
Ed PER

Uh, O 
something O

that, O 
but, O 
uh, O 
I O 
don't O 
know O 
what O 
the O 
exact O 
conditions O 
were O

in O 
that O

they O

of O

as O

as, O 
as, O 
ah, O 
the O 
United O

sending O 
a O 
senior O 
~US O

I O 
think O 
they O 
should've O 
sent O 
someone O 
-- O 
I O 
don't O 
know O 
how O 
senior O 
that O

uh, O 
it O 
could've O 
been O 
a O 
gesture O 
Ed PER
Well O 
they O 
did O 
-- O 
they O 
did O 
send O 
somebody, O 
I O 
thought. O 
Didn't O 
they O 
go O 
with O 
a O 
senior O

I O 
had O 
James PER

I O

Oh O 
y- O 
yeah, O 
you're O 
right, O 
they O 
did O 
send O 
someone. O 
Ed PER
but O 
it O 
wasn't O 
-- O 
like, O 
ah, O 
wasn't O 
Bush, PER

definitely O 
wouldn't O 
send O 
him, O 
I O 
don't O

you O 
want O 
to O

him O 
in O 
that O 
part O 
of O 
the O

right O 
now. O 
James PER
Right. O 
No. O 
No. O 
No, O 
I O 
don't O 
think O 
Ed PER
Regardless O 
of O 
what O 
you O 
think O 
about O 
him, O 
he's, O 
ah O 
James PER
Yeah, O 
I O 
don't O 
think O 
he O 
should O 
have O 
went O 
-- O 
as O 
a O 
matter O 
of O 
fact, O 
I O 
don't O 
think O 
any O 
senior O 
official O 
should've O 
went, O 
I O 
don't O 
think O 
-- O 
Secretary O 
of O 
State O 
Colin PER
Powell PER
should O 
have O 
went. O 
Uh, O 
whoever O 
they O 
sent O 
was, O 
was O 
good O 
enough. O 
Ed PER
Yeah. O 
James PER
Yeah, O 
was O 
good O 
enough, O 
just O 
to O 
show O 
-- O 
the O 
Palestinian O 
people O 
-- O 
that, O 
uh O 
you O 
know, O 
America O 
does O 
care O 
somewhat O 
-- O 
that O 
you've O 
lost O 
your O 
leader. O 
But, O 
uh, O 
no, O 
it O 
would've O 
been O 
-- O 
it O 
would've O 
been O 
a O 
wro- O 
as O 
a O 
matter O 
of O 
fact, O 
I O 
think O 
sending O 
Bush PER
would O 
have O 
made O 
it O 
worse. O 
You O 
know. O 
Uh, O 
because O 
he's O 
not O 
liked O 
that O 
much O 
by O 
the O 
Palestinian O 
people. O 
So O 
I, O 
I O 
don't O 
think O 
sending O 
him O 
would've O 
been O 
-- O 
would've O 
been O 
the O 
right O 
thing O 
to O 
do. O 
Ed PER
No, O 
I O 
agree O 
with O 
that. O 
James PER
Yeah, O 
I O 
don't O 
think O 
it O 
would've O 
added O 
anything O 
to O 
-- O 
to O 
the O 
situation. O 
and O 
possibly O 
could've O 
made O 
it O 
worse. O 
Ed PER
Yeah. O 
James PER

Ed PER
As O 
to O

political O

James PER
Huh. O 
Right. O 
Ed PER
you O 
know, O 
there O 
is O 
no O 
right O 
answer, O 
considering O 
that O 
that O 
is O 
not O 
James PER
Mhm. O 
Ed PER
you O 
know, O 
they're O 
still O 
arguing O 
over O 
-- O 
that O

ah O 
James PER

who O 
owns O

so O 
I O 
mean O 
it's O 
James PER

I'd O 
say O 
my O 
overall O 
opinion O 
is O 
that O 
-- O 
this O 
conflict O 
is O 
way O 
past O 
that O 
time. O 
Ed PER
Yeah, O 
well, O 
James PER
You O

it's O

going O

all O 
these O 
many O

what, O 
Ed PER
Hundreds. O 
James PER
hundreds O 
of O 
years O 
-- O 
and O 
a O

of O 
people O 
have O 
lost O 
their O

and O 
and O 
a O 
lot O 
of O 
kids O 
have O 
grown O 
up O 
and O 
all O 
they've O 
ever O 
known O 
-- O 
on O 
both O 
sides O 
Israeli O 
and O 
Palestinian, O 
all O 
they've O 
ever O 
known O 
is O 
war. O 
And O 
it's O 
just O 
tiresome. O 
I O 
mean, O 
that's, O 
that's O 
my, O 
my O 
view, O 
this O 
thing O 
has O 
gone O 
so O

you O

the O 
Palestinians O 
will, O 
will, O 
will O 
-- O 
will O 
-- O 
will O 
do O 
something, O 
then O 
Israel O 
will O 
respond, O 
and O 
then O 
back O 
and O 
forth O 
-- O 
and O 
it's O 
just O 
like O 
a O 
never O 
ending O

It's O 
like O 
a O 
never O

And, O 
like O 
I O

I'm O

I O 
guess O 
now O 
that O 
that O 
he's O 
he's O 
died O 
-- O 
it'll O 
be, O 
uh, O 
or O 
it O 
it O 
should O 
be O 
a O 
change O 
for O 
the O 
~PLO ORG
Mike PER
Well, O 
yeah, O 
it'll O 
be O 
change. O 
I O 
I O 
don't O 
know O 
if O 
it'll O 
move O 
forward O 
any O 
better O 
-- O 
but, O 
uh, O 
this, O 
uh, O 
I've O 
heard O 
our O 
administration O 
thinks O 
it O 
will. O 
I O 
think O 
he O 
was O 
a O 
block O 
to O 
the O 
peace O 
-- O 
but O 
I O 
think O 
it's O 
not O 
only O 
his O 
doing, O 
it's O 
also O 
the O 
-- O 
you O 
know, O 
the, O 
uh, O 
more, O 
uh, O 
drastic O 
elements O 
of O 
the O 
~PLO ORG
that, O 
uh, O 
that, O 
uh, O 
wouldn't O 
allow O 
him O 
to O 
pursue O 
peace O 
Paul PER
Right. O 
Mike PER
at O 
any O 
cost. O 
Paul PER
Well, O 
I'm O 
-- O 
I'm O 
-- O 
I O 
don't O 
know, O 
uh. O 
He O 
he O 
seems O 
like O 
a O 
guy O 
who O 
is O 
much O 
more O 
comfortable O 
-- O 
being O 
under O 
siege O 
than O 
in O 
negotiating O 
peace O 
settlements. O 
Mike PER
Uh-huh. O 
Paul PER
Um, O 
I O 
Mike PER
Yeah. O 
Paul PER
maybe O 
that O 
Mike PER
Well, O 
you O 
know, O 
he O 
was O 
kind O 
of O 
damned O 
if O 
he O 
did O 
and O 
damned O 
if O 
he O 
didn't. O 
Paul PER
Yeah. O 
Well O 
Mike PER
You O 
know, O 
if O 
he O 
if O 
he O 
made O 
peace O 
he O 
had O 
factions O 
of O 
his O 
own O 
people O 
that O 
would've O 
killed O 
him O 
-- O 
and O 
if O 
he O 
didn't O 
make O 
peace, O 
eh, O 
then O 
he's O 
considered, O 
you O 
know, O 
the O 
the O 
warmongering, O 
uh, O 
man O 
who O 
won't O 
make O 
peace, O 
you O 
know. O 
So, O 
he, O 
uh, O 
he O 
couldn't O 
really O 
win. O 
I O 
don't O 
think O 
he O 
could O 
make O 
peace. O 
I O 
don't O 
know O 
if O 
anyone O 
else O 
can, O 
either. O 
Paul PER
Yeah, O 
I O 
guess O 
that's O 
the O 
big O 
question, O 
if O 
someone O 
moderate O 
takes O 
over O 
and O 
they O 
reach O 
a O 
settlement, O 
does O 
that O 
mean O 
the O 
~PLO ORG
will O 
split? O 
I O 
mean O 
that O 
-- O 
that O 
could O 
be O 
just O 
-- O 
dangerous. O 
Mike PER
Yeah. O 
Paul PER
I O 
guess, O 
uh, O 
making O 
peace O 
with O 
half O 
of O 
the O 
Palestinians O 
is O 
better O 
than O 
nothing. O 
Mike PER
One O 
of O 
the O 
other O 
questions O 
it O 
asked O 
us O 
was, O 
did O 
we O 
think O 
our O 
president O 
and O 
our, O 
uh, O 
you O 
know, O 
officials O 
should've O 
attended O 
his O 
funeral. O 
Paul PER
((Oh, O 
I O 
b-)) O 
Mike PER
What O 
do O 
you O 
think O 
about O 
that? O 
Paul PER
Yeah. O 
Well, O 
I O 
I O 
don't O 
remember O 
who O 
they O 
sent, O 
but O 
they O 
did O 
send O 
over O 
some O 
very O 
-- O 
low O 
level O 
state ORG
department ORG
person O 
Mike PER
Oh, O 
I O 
see. O 
Paul PER
and, O 
uh, O 
Mike PER
I O 
didn't O 
know O 
that. O 
Paul PER
I O 
I O 
-- O 
I O 
was O 
kind O 
of O 
embarrassed O 
about O 
that. O 
Mike PER
That O 
we O 
did O 
or O 
d- O 
that O 
we O 
did O 
not O 
send O 
our O 
officials. O 
Paul PER
I O 
mean O 
-- O 
We O 
-- O 
we O 
did, O 
but O 
i- O 
it O 
was O 
some O 
-- O 
it O 
was O 
a O 
nobody, O 
basically. O 
Mike PER
So O 
you O 
were O 
embarrassed O 
because O 
you O 
thought O 
they O 
should've O 
sent O 
someone O 
higher O 
up? O 
Paul PER
Yeah. O 
Mike PER
Oh, O 
I O 
see. O 
Paul PER
I O 
I O 
-- O 
I O 
mean, O 
for O 
for O 
the O 
funeral O 
ceremony O 
in, O 
uh, O 
Egypt. O 
((I O 
mean)) O 
Mike PER
Yeah, O 
I O 
think O 
so, O 
too. O 
I O 
think O 
they O 
should've O 
sent O 
someone O 
higher O 
up. O 
Paul PER
And, O 
uh, O 
I O 
I O 
can O 
understand O 
that O 
they O 
wouldn't O 
want O 
to O 
send O 
anybody O 
Mike PER
((that O 
he)) O 
-- O 
Don't O 
forget O 
this O 
was O 
the O 
this O 
was O 
the O 
representative O 
of O 
a O 
whole O 
people, O 
you O 
know O 
what O 
I O 
mean? O 
Paul PER
Yeah. O 
Mike PER
The O 
past O 
he O 
was O 
their O 
main O 
representative O 
and, O 
uh, O 
just O 
out O 
of O 
respect O 
for O 
the O 
people O 
we O 
should've O 
sent O 
someone O 
I O 
think. O 
Paul PER
Hm. O 
Bad O 
bad O 
or O 
good. O 
Yeah, O 
I O 
think O 
it O 
would've O 
been O 
a O 
much O 
more O 
positive O 
message. O 
Mike PER
Yeah. O 
Paul PER
((We O 
realized O 
that)) O 
Mike PER
I O 
think O 
it O 
would've, O 
uh, O 
you O 
know, O 
been O 
a O 
-- O 
a O 
step O 
toward, O 
um, O 
you O 
know, O 
gaining O 
the, O 
uh, O 
I O 
don't O 
know, O 
the O 
respect O 
and O 
and O 
the, O 
um, O 
Paul PER
Right. O 
Yeah, O 
I O 
think O 
that O 
Mike PER
uh, O 
th- O 
of O 
the O 
people O 
that O 
we're O 
going O 
to O 
have O 
to O 
be O 
working O 
with O 
to O 
try O 
to O 
bring O 
about O 
a O 
peace, O 
you O 
know. O 
Paul PER
that O 
((yeah,)) O 
it O 
-- O 
Yeah. O 
Mike PER
And, O 
uh, O 
it O 
would've O 
-- O 
gone O 
an- O 
a O 
little O 
farther O 
to O 
encourage O 
them O 
to, O 
you O 
know, O 
be O 
willing O 
to O 
sit O 
down O 
at O 
the O 
table O 
with O 
us, O 
at O 
least, O 
you O 
know. O 
Paul PER
That's O 
true. O 
Mike PER
And, O 
I O 
mean O 
not O 
that O 
it O 
would've O 
even O 
been O 
noticed O 
-- O 
in O 
that O 
regard O 
had O 
he O 
-- O 
had O 
had O 
our O 
president O 
or O 
someone O 
higher O 
gone, O 
but O 
the O 
fact O 
that O 
they O 
didn't, O 
that's O 
what's O 
really O 
going O 
to O 
be O 
noticed, O 
you O 
know O 
what O 
I O 
mean? O 
Paul PER
Yeah. O 
Well, O 
uh, O 
you O 
know, O 
Colin PER
Powell PER
is O 
a O 
-- O 
pretty O 
moderate O 
guy O 
and O 
would've O 
been O 
nice O 
to O 
see O 
him O 
there O 
or O 
maybe O 
-- O 
the, O 
uh, O 
Deputy O 
-- O 
Secret O 
of O 
State. O 
Mike PER
Uh-huh. O 
Paul PER
I'm O 
not O 
even O 
sure O 
who O 
that O 
is. O 
Eh, O 
somebody O 
will O 
-- O 
or O 
higher O 
up. O 
Mike PER
Yeah, O 
someone O 
m- O 
a O 
little O 
more, O 
uh O 
Paul PER
Some O 
flunky O 
bureaucrat. O 
Mike PER
yeah. O 
Yeah, O 
it O 
didn't O 
seem O 
quite O 
appropriate. O 
Paul PER
But, O 
uh, O 
at O 
at O 
least O 
for O 
the O 
ceremony O 
in O 
Egypt O 
I O 
think, O 
uh, O 
I O 
can O 
understand O 
that O 
no O 
one O 
would O 
want O 
to O 
go O 
into O 
-- O 
Palestinian O 
territory. O 
I O 
mean, O 
they O 
it O 
was O 
total O 
chaos O 
there. O

Uh-huh. O

Yeah. O

What O 
do O 
you O

caused O 
his O 
illness, O 
and O 
could O 
it O 
have O 
been O 
something O 
malicious O

poisoning)? O 
What O 
do O 
you O 
think O 
of O 
Israel's O

Arafat's PER

and O 
death? O 
Should O 
President O 
Bush PER

a O 
senior O

okay, O 
um, O 
((lot O 
of O

-- O 
and, O 
um, O 
I- O 
I O 
don't O 
think O 
it O 
was O 
poisoning, O 
even O 
though O 
I O 
haven't O 
read O 
-- O 
a O 
lot O 
of O 
articles O 
about O 
it. O 
I O 
think- O 
Mike PER
He- O 
he O 
was O 
old. O 
I O 
mean- O 
Marco PER
Y- O 
he O 
was O 
old, O 
yeah. O 
And- O 
-- O 
and O 
that- O 
I- O 
I O 
didn't O 
realize O 
he O 
wasn't O 
allowed O 
to O 
be O 
buried O 
in O 
Jerusalem, O 
which- O 
Mike PER
Yeah, O 
but O 
a O 
lot O 
of O 
that O 
has O 
to O 
do O 
with O 
things O 
that O 
he's O 
done. O 
Marco PER

Mike PER
He's- O 
I O 
mean, O 
like, O 
you O 
know, O 
let's- O 
i- O 
-- O 
for- O 
for O 
all O 
he O 
did O 
in O 
his O 
later O 
years, O 
eh, O 
Yasser PER
Arafat PER
was O 
responsible O 
for O 
-- O 
a O 
good O 
chunk O 
of O 
al- O 
you O 
know, O 
a O 
lot O 
of O 
-- O 
Israeli O 
dying O 
-- O 
i- O 
you O 
know. O 
He O 
basically, O 
eh, O 
i- O 
I'm O 
completely O 
torn O 
on O 
the O 
whole O 
thing. O 
I O 
mean, O 
on O 
one O 
hand O 
-- O 
I O 
think O 
it O 
was O 
kind O 
of O 
wrong O 
that O 
-- O 
that O 
-- O 
you O 
know, O 
the O

what? O

know, O 
we're- O 
we're O 
you O 
know, O 
this O 
is O 
Israel O 
now, O 
state O 
of O 
Israel. O 
And O 
basically O 
what O 
they O 
did O 
was O 
they O 
carved O 
up O 
the O

-- O 
without O 
any O 
regard O 
to, O 
you O 
know, O 
tribal O

there O

it's O

a O

was O

you O

how O 
we O

that O

some O

a O

the O

you O

he O

Well O 
-- O 
I, O 
uh, O 
I O

there O 
was O 
anything O 
malicious, O 
uh, O 
in O 
terms O 
of O 
his O

uh, O 
just O 
looking O 
at O 
him O 
these O

uh, O

uh, O 
it O 
seems O 
like O 
he O 
had O 
Alzheimer's O

something. O 
Joe PER
Yeah, O 
he O 
has O 
been O 
getting O

Yeah, O 
because O 
he O 
was O 
quivering O 
at O 
the O

I O 
would O

that O

couldn't O 
have O 
been O 
that O 
conducive O 
to O 
his O

Yeah, O 
he O 
probably O 
should O 
have O 
been O 
in O 
a O

or O 
a O

or O 
James PER
Right. O 
Joe PER
you O

if O 
it O 
was O

bad. O 
James PER
Right. O 
Right, O 
I'm O 
sure O 
that O 
they, O 
I O 
don't O 
know O 
about, O 
bout O

the O 
uh O 
sanitary O 
conditions O 
there, O

-- O 
I O 
I O 
just O 
don't O 
think O 
it O 
could O 
have O

uh, O 
conducive O 
to O 
his O 
health. O 
And O

far O 
as, O

allowing O

him O 
to O

That's O 
acceptable O 
to O

Well, O 
it, O 
it's O 
acceptable O

me, O 
but O 
I O 
don't O 
think O 
it O 
was O 
feasible. O 
Joe PER
feasible O 
James PER
Yeah, O 
given O 
the O 
circumstance O 
in O 
that O 
area O 
right O 
now. O 
I O 
don't O 
even O 
know O 
if O 
they O 
would O 
have O 
been O

to O 
pull O 
it O 
off, O 
you O 
know? O

Well, O 
uh, O 
so O 
he, O 
in O 
fact O 
he O 
wasn't O 
James PER
Pardon O

Joe PER
so, O 
um O 
-- O 
no, O 
so O 
he O

Jerusalem. O

No. O 
No, O 
they O 
buried O 
him O

Oh, O 
I O

James PER
Yeah, O 
they O

him O 
inside O 
that O

But O 
like O 
you O

I O

I O 
don't O 
-- O 
I O 
personally O 
-- O 
uh O 
-- O 
wouldn't O 
have O 
seen O 
a O 
problem O 
with O

but O 
-- O 
I O 
just O 
don't O 
think O 
it O 
was O 
feasible. O 
I O 
don't, O 
I O 
don't O 
think O 
that O 
they O 
would O 
have O 
been O 
-- O 
uh, O 
secure O 
enough O 
to O 
really O 
do O 
it. O 
I O 
don't O 
think O 
either O 
side O 
would O 
have O 
really O 
-- O 
let O 
it O 
happen O 
-- O 
and O 
-- O 
and O 
as O 
far O 
as O 
a O 
senior O 
U.S. O

going, O 
I O 
don't O 
think O 
that O 
would O 
have O 
been O 
necessary O 
either. O 
Um, O 
I O 
know O 
President O

I O 
kind O

feel, O 
I O

another O

I O 
think O 
a O 
senior O 
U.S. O 
service O 
in O 
there, O 
should O 
have O 
been O 
there, O 
because O 
I O

Arafat's PER

-- O 
been O 
the O 
one O 
coming O

showed O 
our O

said O 
you O 
know, O

we O

this O

who O 
it O 
was O

((It O 
wasn't)) O

It O 
probably, O 
it O 
wasn't O 
anybody O 
important. O 
It O 
was O 
just O 
like O 
a O 
James PER
Yeah O 
it O 
was O 
an O 
under O

there's O 
no O 
doubt O 
about O 
it. O 
There O 
was O 
no O 
senior O 
Joe PER
James PER
there O 
was O 
no O 
senior O 
U.S. O 
official O 
there. O 
There's O 
there's O 
no O 
question O 
about O 
that. O 
Joe PER
Yeah. O 
James PER
But, O 
uh O 
-- O 
you O 
know, O 
uh, O 
Bush's PER

-- O 
towards, O 
uh, O 
Yasser PER
Arafat PER
has O 
been O 
hands O 
off O

from O 
from O 
the O

I O 
don't, O 
I O 
don't O 
think O 
he O 
ever O 
even O 
met O 
with O 
him. O 
Did O 
he? O 
Joe PER
I O 
don't O 
think O 
so. O 
I O 
don't O

so. O 
James PER

I O

into O

James PER
You're O 
absolutely O 
right. O 
I O 
agree. O 
Like O 
I O 
said, O 
I O 
think O 
that O 
was O 
one O 
of O 
Bush's PER
biggest O 
mistakes, O 
Joe PER
Mhm. O 
James PER
not O 
continuing O

Because O

had O 
came O 
so O 
very O 
close O 
Joe PER
Yes. O 
James PER
to O 
to O 
maybe O 
getting O 
some O 
type O 
of O 
agreement O 
Joe PER
No. O 
James PER
but, O 
uh, O 
Bush PER
just O 
took O 
a O 
hands O 
off O 
approach. O 
He O 
just O 
-- O 
kind O 
of O 
took O 
a O 
hands O 
off O 
approach. O 
Joe PER
And O 
now O 
the O 
situation O 
in, O 
you O 
know, O 
Jerusalem O 
and O 
the O 
West O 
Bank O 
is O 
just O 
-- O 
escalated. O 
James PER
Absolutely. O 
And O 
I O 
think O 
too O 
-- O 
Israel's O 
-- O 
position O 
toward O 
Arafat PER
-- O 
in O 
terms O 
of O 
keeping O 
him O 
sort O 
of O 
like O 
-- O 
uh O 
-- O 
surrounded O 
in O 
that O 
compound O 
-- O 
I O 
don't O 
think O 
that O 
was O 
a O 
good O 
idea. O 
Joe PER
No. O 
James PER
You O 
know, O 
because O 
that, O 
you O 
can't O 
pick O 
a O 
leader O 
for O 
a O 
people. O 
Whether O 
you O 
like O 
them O 
or O 
not O 
-- O 
people O 
get O 
to O 
choose O 
who O 
they O 
want O 
to O 
follow, O 
Joe PER
Exactly. O 
James PER
and O 
the O 
Palestinians O 
had O 
made O 
it O 
clear O 
-- O 
that O 
Arafat PER
was O 
their O 
leader. O 
Joe PER
Exactly. O 
James PER
So, O 
I O 
think O 
that O 
they, O 
we O 
should O 
have O 
found O 
a O 
way O 
-- O 
Israel O 
should O 
have O

anything. O

to O 
a O 
lot O 
of O 
parties O 
with O 
friends, O 
neighbors, O 
co-workers O 
or O 
family O 
members? O 
Are O

people O

see O 
during O 
the O 
holidays O 
that O 
you O 
don't O 
see O 
during O 
the O 
rest O 
of O 
the O 
year? O 
Do O 
you O 
travel O 
to O 
meet O 
up O 
with O 
family O 
or O 
friends O 
during O 
the O 
holidays? O 
Where O 
do O 
you O 
go O 
and O 
who O 
do O 
you O 
visit? O 
Ed O 
Hi O 
this O 
is O 
Ed. PER
good. O 
how O 
are O 
you O 
doing O 
Jane? PER
if O 
you O 
hear O 
noise O 
in O 
the O 
background, O 
I'm O 
enjoying O 
the O 
holiday O 
season O 
walking O 
in O 
New O 
York O 
City, O 
so O 
Jane O 
Oh, O 
okay. O 
Ed O 
((city)) O 
-- O 
((trusts O 
of O 
life)) O 
-- O 
crazy O 
people O 
and, O 
uh, O 
other O 
things O 
going O 
on O 
but O 
that's O 
New O 
York, O 
what O 
can O 
you O 
say. O 
Jane O 
Yeah O 
yeah O 
yeah. O 
Used O 
to O 
live O 
in O 
New O 
York. O 
My O 
brother-in-law O 
still O 
lives O 
in O 
the O 
city O 
but O 
we O 
were O 
Long O 
Island O 
people. O 
Ed O 
Yeah. O 
Uh, O 
so O 
what O 
are O 
you O 
doing O 
for O 
the O 
festive O 
holidays. O 
Jane O 
You O 
know, O 
it's O 
really O 
bad O 
because O 
I O 
still O 
really O 
don't O 
know. O 
I'm O 
up O 
in O 
the O 
air O 
with O 
about O 
six O 
different O 
clients O 
trying O 
to O 
decide O 
what O 
we're O 
going O 
to O 
do. O 
Ed O 
((Allan)) O 
-- PER
Well, O 
that's O 
not O 
bad. O 
That O 
means O 
that O 
you've O 
got O 
a O 
lot O 
of O 
people O 
to O 
see O 
and O 
do O 
things O 
with. O 
That's O 
good. O 
Jane O 
Yeah, O 
makes O 
it O 
kind O 
of O 
hectic. O 
How O 
about O 
you? O 
What O 
are O 
you O 
doing? O 
Ed O 
Ah, O 
family. O 
Jane O 
Ach. O 
Ed O 
Yeah. O 
Yeah, O 
we're O 
going O 
to O 
be O 
doing, O 
uh, O 
the O 
typical. O 
Go O 
up O 
and O 
celebrate O 
with O 
the O 
family O 
and O 
-- O 
be O 
with O 
the O 
little O 
kids. O 
You O 
know, O 
the O 
((tough O 
years)) O 
and O 
that O 
which O 
makes O 
it O 
-- O 
because O 
when O 
you O 
get O 
older O 
it's O 
kind O 
of, O 
I've O 
got O 
all O 
the O 
gifts, O 
I O 
don't O 
need O 
that. O 
What O 
I O 
really O 
want O 
to O 
do O 
is O 
see O 
somebody O 
else O 
enjoy O 
it O 
and O 
the O 
little O 
kids O 
enjoy O 
it. O 
So- O 
-- O 
and, O 
uh, O 
do O 
a O 
lot O 
of O 
parties O 
with O 
family O 
-- O 
and O 
friends. O 
Jane O 
Well, O 
that's O 
kind O 
of O 
where- O 
we're O 
in O 
between O 
which O 
family O 
we're O 
going O 
to O 
see O 
and O 
when O 
and O 
how O 
and O 
get O 
all O 
that O 
worked O 
out. O 
Ed O 
Uh, O 
Jane O 
Ed O 
so O 
whoev- O 
yeah, O 
I've O 
seen O 
them- O 
-- O 
just O 
not O 
the O 
gifts O 
it O 
comes O 
down O 
to O 
the O 
food. O 
See, O 
now O 
you O 
(()). O 
Jane O 
There O 
you O 
go. O 
I- O 
one O 
of O 
these O 
choices O 
is O 
meat O 
cooking. O 
We'll O 
have O 
to O 
put O 
that O 
towards O 
the O 
end. O 
Ed O 
((Ah, O 
oui.)) O 
-- O 
Eh, O 
((nice)). O 
So O 
we- O 
we've O 
only- O 
Jane O 
Ed O 
my O 
family's, O 
uh, O 
parents O 
are O 
deceased O 
and O 
most O 
of O 
((them)) O 
is, O 
uh, O 
passed O 
my O 
brothers O 
all O 
over, O 
so O 
her O 
family's O 
still O 
younger O 
-- O 
and, O 
uh, O 
you O 
know, O 
just O 
the O 
odd O 
sides. O 
She's O 
the O 
oldest O 
and O 
I'm O 
the O 
youngest, O 
so O 
she's O 
got O 
younger O 
which O 
-- O 
keeps O 
the O 
thing O 
going, O 
so O 
I- O 
-- O 
you O 
know, O 
my O 
view O 
is O 
-- O 
((stay)) O 
with O 
the O 
family O 
go O 
visit O 
the O 
family. O 
That's O 
all O 
you O 
got. O 
So O 
-- O 
keep O 
it O 
together O 
through O 
thick O 
and O 
thin O 
and O 
-- O 
when O 
it O 
comes O 
to O 
Thanksgiving O 
we O 
go O 
up O 
there O 
and O 
we O 
celebrate. O 
And O 
then O 
there's O 
little O 
parties. O 
Big- O 
uh, O 
her O 
sister O 
does O 
a O 
big O 
family O 
party O 
-- O 
but O 
try O 
to O 
keep O 
that O 
same O 
Jane O 
Ed O 
local O 
family O 
coming O 
together. O 
It's O 
amazing O 
how O 
they O 
can O 
get O 
into O 
little O 
squabbles O 
and O 
who O 
doesn't O 
show O 
up O 
Jane O 
Of O 
course. O 
Ed O 
like O 
that. O 
I O 
think O 
it's O 
crazy. O 
So, O 
((so, O 
uh))- O 
Jane O 
They O 
used O 
to O 
always O 
really O 
all O 
get O 
together. O 
but O 
his O 
parents O 
uh O 
they O 
actually O 
live O 
next O 
door O 
to O 
us. O 
but O 
they're O 
starting O 
to O 
get O 
up O 
in O 
the O 
years, O 
so O 
they're O 
not, O 
you O 
know, O 
hosting O 
the O 
big O 
parties, O 
so O 
it's O 
funny O 
how O 
now O 
people O 
don't O 
all O 
bother O 
to O 
come O 
Ed O 
Yeah. O 
Jane O 
and O 
you O 
kind O 
of O 
wonder O 
you O 
know O 
in O 
the O 
next O 
couple O 
of O 
years O 
what's O 
all O 
going O 
to O 
happen. O 
Are O 
they O 
all O 
going O 
to O 
see O 
each O 
other. O 
Ed O 
Yeah, O 
no O 
that's- O 
that's O 
exactly. O 
I've O 
already O 
seen, O 
you O 
know, O 
((in)) O 
my O 
parents O 
((' O 
bed)) O 
until O 
they O 
((got)) O 
less O 
and O 
less O 
that O 
the O 
brothers O 
got O 
together O 
-- O 
and O 
then O 
now O 
when O 
there's O 
an O 
event O 
you O 
try O 
to O 
do O 
it. O 
At O 
Christmas O 
it's O 
just O 
impossible O 
because O 
we O 
leave O 
-- O 
two O 
days O 
after O 
Christmas O 
Jane O 
Mhm. O 
Ed O 
to O 
go O 
out O 
of O 
the O 
country O 
as O 
part O 
of O 
our O 
New O 
Year's O 
Jane O 
Ed O 
celebration. O 
So, O 
for O 
us O 
it's, O 
you O 
know, O 
got O 
to O 
be O 
a O 
quick O 
trip O 
up O 
Jane O 
Ed O 
to O 
her O 
family O 
and O 
then O 
back O 
where O 
we- O 
-- O 
we've O 
been O 
invited O 
to O 
be O 
down O 
in O 
Jane O 
Ed O 
another O 
country. O 
If O 
a O 
person O 
is O 
not- O 
even O 
though O 
it's O 
cold O 
up O 
in O 
the O 
Northeast, O 
it's O 
a O 
family O 
tradition. O 
I O 
should O 
do O 
it O 
-- O 
and O 
less O 
for O 
the O 
gifts O 
and O 
more O 
for O 
Jane O 
Ed O 
being O 
together. O 
Yeah. O 
Jane O 
Well, O 
we O 
did- O 
-- O 
-for O 
the O 
kids O 
you O 
know O 
we O 
made O 
it O 
pretty O 
cl- O 
Ed O 
I O 
don't O 
know, O 
I O 
think O 
that's O 
great. O 
Jane O 
-you O 
know, O 
you O 
didn't O 
have O 
all O 
the O 
hassle O 
of O 
running O 
around O 
and O 
being O 
crazy O 
and O 
just O 
kind O 
of O 
spent O 
time O 
together O 
Ed O 
And O 
I O 
think O 
that's O 
very- O 
I O 
mean, O 
if- O 
Jane O 
and O 
it O 
was O 
really O 
pretty O 
nice. O 
Ed O 
Yeah, O 
we O 
haven't- O 
-- O 
yeah, O 
I O 
think O 
-- O 
e- O 
e- O 
eventually O 
that O 
may O 
happen, O 
the O 
way O 
we're O 
going O 
with, O 
uh, O 
Jane O 
Ed O 
my O 
wife O 
and O 
I O 
with O 
her O 
Jane O 
Ed O 
family. O 
Not O 
as O 
a O 
negative O 
but O 
as O 
a- O 
Jane O 
Ed O 
you O 
know, O 
we O 
do O 
a O 
lot O 
of O 
traveling O 
so O 
that's O 
going O 
to O 
be- O 
I O 
think O 
that's O 
going O 
to O 
come O 
up. O 
Jane O 
Ed O 
But- O 
-- O 
but O 
for O 
now O 
we're O 
still O 
trying O 
to O 
do- O 
Jane O 
Ed O 
as O 
long O 
as O 
the O 
mother's O 
around, O 
we'll O 
still O 
do O 
Christmas O 
and O 
act O 
as- O 
Jane O 
Ed O 
she O 
is O 
not O 
really O 
old, O 
but O 
she's O 
getting O 
older, O 
so O 
I O 
think O 
that's O 
one O 
reason O 
to O 
stay O 
together O 
Jane O 
Ed O 
and O 
also O 
I O 
think O 
i- O 
is O 
Jane O 
Ed O 
eh, O 
we- O 
we O 
kind O 
of O 
-- O 
infused O 
a O 
little O 
family O 
party O 
that O 
her O 
sister O 
has O 
so O 
-- O 
I O 
think O 
if O 
we O 
were O 
to O 
go O 
away O 
both O 
of O 
those O 
might O 
fall O 
off O 
a O 
little O 
bit O 
and O 
it O 
doesn't O 
take O 
but O 
one O 
year O 
and O 
then O 
all O 
of O 
the O 
sudden O 
everybody's O 
Jane O 
Yeah. O 
Ed O 
not O 
coming O 
to O 
it O 
anymore O 
and O 
it's O 
like O 
a- O 
Jane O 
That's O 
it. O 
That's O 
the O 
way O 
it O 
is. O 
Ed O 
Yeah, O 
but O 
not O 
because- O 
Jane O 
If O 
I'm O 
no- O 
Ed O 
it O 
is- O 
-- O 
I- O 
I O 
enjoy O 
the O 
-- O 
smiling O 
people O 
and O 
the O 
festive- O 
-- O 
festive O 
nature O 
and O 
-- O 
I O 
think O 
it O 
does O 
get O 
a O 
little O 
commercialized. O 
((It's O 
not O 
that O 
the-)) O 
-- O 
You O 
can O 
ignore O 
that O 
part O 
of O 
it, O 
I O 
guess. O

Do O

Ryan PER
It's O 
religious O 
for O 
us. O 
Um, O 
Christmas, O 
not O 
Hanukkah O 
or O 
anything O 
like O 
that. O 
Deirdre PER
Uh-huh, O 
so O 
yo- O 
you O 
have O 
a O 
church O 
service? O 
Ryan PER
Um, O 
actually, O 
usually O 
we're O 
out O 
of O 
town O 
so O 
we O 
don't O 
attend O 
our O 
church. O 
Deirdre PER
So O 
you O 
go O 
with, O 
um, O 
family, O 
friends? O 
Ryan PER
Family, O 
yeah. O 
Deirdre PER
Family? O 
Ryan PER
It's O 
almost O 
always O 
my O 
grandma. O 
Deirdre PER
Your O 
gran- O 
you O 
go O 
to O 
your O 
grandma's O 
house. O 
Ryan PER
Mhm. O 
Deirdre PER
Yeah, O 
that's O 
what O 
we O 
do. O 
Every O 
year, O 
uh, O 
but O 
I O 
don't O 
always O 
attend. O 
Uh, O 
my O 
family O 
-- O 
celebrates O 
the O 
sun O 
shining. O 
They're O 
always O 
together. O 
So, O 
uh, O 
it's O 
not O 
particularly O 
special O 
at O 
Christmas O 
-- O 
because O 
they O 
see O 
each O 
other O 
every O 
other O 
weekend. O 
But, O 
still, O 
uh, O 
they O 
go O 
to, O 
uh, O 
grandmother's PER
-- O 
every O 
Christmas. O 
A O 
particular O 
person's O 
house O 
every O 
holiday O 
season. O 
You O 
know, O 
whether O 
it's O 
Christmas O 
or O 
-- O 
Thanksgiving O 
or O 
Mother's PER
Day O 
or O 
Easter, O 
it O 
just O 
alternates O 
it- O 
you O 
know, O 
each- O 
uh, O 
a O 
particular O 
person's O 
house O 
is- O 
is O 
how O 
they O 
do O 
it. O 
Ryan PER
Oh. O 
Deirdre PER
I O 
just O 
don't O 
always O 
attend. O 
Just- O 
-- O 
I O 
don't O 
know, O 
it's- O 
-- O 
there's O 
just O 
so O 
much O 
of O 
my O 
family O 
I O 
can O 
take O 
during O 
one O 
year, O 
you O 
know, O 
but- O 
Ryan PER
Well, O 
um, O 
since O 
they O 
see O 
each O 
other O 
so O 
much, O 
is O 
there O 
anything O 
that O 
does O 
make O 
it O 
special? O 
Deirdre PER
Well, O 
I O 
guess O 
they O 
seem O 
to O 
think O 
it's O 
just O 
special O 
because O 
-- O 
everyone O 
comes. O 
I- O 
I- O 
it's- O 
-- O 
it's O 
just, O 
I O 
don't O 
know, O 
old. O 
Y- O 
you O 
know, O 
it's- O 
it's O 
not- O 
-- O 
it's O 
not O 
special O 
to O 
me O 
because O 
they O 
do O 
it O 
all O 
the O 
time. O 
You O 
know, O 
special O 
would O 
make O 
it, O 
I O 
only O 
see O 
you O 
once O 
a O 
year. O 
It's O 
just O 
not- O 
it's O 
just O 
not O 
special O 
if O 
I O 
see O 
you O 
every O 
other O 
month. O 
Ryan PER
Yeah. O 
Deirdre PER
You O 
know, O 
it's O 
just O 
not. O 
I O 
mean, O 
you O 
know, O 
not O 
like, O 
you're O 
seeing O 
your O 
mother O 
-- O 
or O 
your O 
sister, O 
maybe O 
your O 
brothers, O 
you O 
know, O 
you- O 
you O 
might- O 
you O 
may O 
see O 
them O 
all O 
the O 
time, O 
but O 
when O 
you O 
see O 
your O 
aunts O 
and O 
uncles O 
and O 
all O 
your O 
cousins O 
-- O 
all O 
the O 
time, O 
where's O 
the O 
break O 
here? O 
But, O 
you O 
know, O 
they O 
like- O 
I O 
don't O 
particularly O 
care O 
for O 
it, O 
but O 
they O 
like O 
it. O 
I O 
did O 
attend O 
Thanksgiving O 
and O 
Ryan PER
Huh. O 
Deirdre PER
that O 
was O 
nice. O 
Um, O 
uh, O 
it O 
was- O 
it O 
was O 
a O 
good O 
day. O 
Uh, O 
but, O 
you O 
know, O 
we- O 
we O 
-- O 
spend O 
all O 
day O 
together. O 
It's O 
not O 
like O 
you O 
just O 
go O 
and O 
eat O 
dinner O 
a O 
couple O 
of O 
hours O 
and O 
go O 
home. O 
You O 
go O 
and O 
you O 
stay O 
twelve O 
hours O 
-- O 
because O 
most O 
of O 
my O 
relatives O 
live O 
within O 
thirty O

Ryan PER
((Ye-)) O 
Deirdre PER
so O 
it's O 
easy. O 
Ryan PER
Oh, O 
wow. O 
Deirdre PER
Yeah. O 
It's O 
easy O 
just O 
to O 
go O 
to O 
someone's O 
house. O 
Ryan PER
Well, O 
sounds O 
a O 
lot O 
like O 
my O 
mom's O 
side O 
of O 
the O 
family O 
because O 
they're O 
all O 
in O 
one O 
city O 
except O 
for O 
Deirdre PER
And- O 
Ryan PER
except O 
for O 
her O 
and, O 
uh, O 
us. O 
Deirdre PER
Well, O 
would O 
you O 
rather O 
be O 
with O 
everyone O 
else O 
or O 
do O 
you O 
like O 
it O 
-- O 
away. O 
Ryan PER
I O 
think O 
I O 
would O 
rather O 
be, O 
but O 
then O 
again O 
-- O 
I O 
talk O 
to O 
my O 
cousin O 
and O 
I'm O 
always O 
asking O 
her O 
how O 
my O 
other O 
cousins O 
are O 
doing O 
and O 
-- O 
she O 
hardly O 
knows O 
because O 
she O 
has- O 
hardly O 
sees O 
them O 
every O 
day. O 
Deirdre PER
Oh. O 
Ryan PER
So O 
I O 
don't O 
think O 
it'd O 
make O 
a O 
big O 
difference. O 
Deirdre PER
For O 
you, O 
yeah, O 
well. O 
I O 
don't O 
((see O 
them O 
or-)) O 
you O 
know, O 
by O 
choice O 
and, O 
you O 
know, O

-- O 
are O 
particular O 
people, O 
you O 
know, O 
but O 
not O 
particular, O 
peculiar O 
people, O 
let's O 
put O 
it O 
that O 
way. O 
It's O 
just O 
-- O

you O

you O

Now, O

too O

my O

just O 
-- O 
you O

she O 
get's O 
into O 
it. O 
She's O 
really O 
sentimental. O 
She's O 
gets O 
into O 
the O 
holiday O 
spirit O 
and O 
wants O 
every O 
light, O 
you O 
know, O 
in O

our O

and, O 
you O

that O 
kind O

thing. O 
Ryan PER
Yeah. O 
Deirdre PER
You O 
know, O 
I- O 
I O 
indulge O 
her, O 
you O 
know. O 
But O 
I O 
don't O 
really O 
get O 
too O 
much O 
into O 
it. O 
You O 
know, O 
the- O 
-- O 
all O 
the, O 
um, O 
trimmings, O 
I O 
suppose, O 
of O 
the O 
holiday O 
season. O 
Uh, O 
but O 
I O 
like, O 
you O 
know, O 
gift O 
giving O 
and O 
-- O 
just, O 
uh, O 
sharing O 
things O 
and O 
just O 
having O 
fun. O 
Just, O 
uh, O 
just O 
don't O 
over O 
do O 
it. O 
But O 
I O 
would O 
prefer, O 
though, O 
um, O 
a O 
service, O 
a O 
spiritual O 
service O 
-- O 
to O 
uh, O 
family's O 
just O 
always O 
together, O 
they're O

together. O 
Now O 
if O 
there O 
was O 
a O 
spiritual O 
service O 
then, O 
yeah, O 
see O 
that O 
would O 
be O 
really O 
special O 
to O 
me. O 
If O 
everybody- O

wh- O

years O

of O

I'm O

where- O 
A O 
Yeah, O 
they O 
said O 
that O 
there O 
were O 
some O

yeah, O 
I O 
s- O 
I O 
saw O 
a O 
story O 
about O

A O

they're- O 
where O 
they're O 
coming O 
home O 
from O

pretty O 
much O 
homeless O 
and- O 
and O 
ha- O

nothing. O 
B O 
Yeah. O 
Yeah, O 
so O 
what O

hell O 
is O 
going O 
on? O 
You O 
know, O 
you're O 
sending O 
these O 
guys O

want O

to O 
be O 
at O 
peace O 
of O 
mind, O 
you O 
know, O 
they- O 
you O 
want O 
them O 
to O 
be O 
able O 
to O 
fight, O 
you O 
know, O 
A O 
That's- O 
-- O 
Eh, O 
yeah. O 
B O 
and O 
to O 
be O 
able O 
to O 
save O 
their O 
lives O 
and O 
they're O 
worried O 
about O 
their O 
families. O 
You O 
know, O 
that's O 
just O 
-- O 
A O 
Yeah, O 
and O 
they O 
c- O 
the O 
come O 
home O 
to O 
nothing O 
after O 
g- O 
all O 
they've O 
gone O 
through O 
they O 
come O 
home O 
and O 
they O 
have O 
nothing. O 
B O 
you O 
can't O 
do O 
that. O 
Yeah. O 
A O 
That's O 
just O 
-- O 
eh, O 
that's O 
just O 
pathetic. O 
B O 
That's O 
what O 
-- O 
you O 
know, O 
that's O 
what O 
people O 
need O 
to, O 
you O 
know, O 
speak O 
up O 
about O 
and O 
nobody- O 
nobody O 
ever O 
does. O 
And- O 
and O 
it's O 
like O 
a, O 
you O 
know, O 
I O 
don't O 
know O 
if O 
you O 
remember, O 
but O 
it O 
was O 
like O 
A O 
Nobody O 
does. O 
I O 
know. O 
B O 
right O 
-- O 
a O 
little O 
bit O 
right O 
after O 
the O 
war O 
started O 
in O 
Iraq O 
there O 
was O 
a O 
soldier O 
that O 
spoke O 
out O 
and O 
he O 
got O 
reprimanded O 
for O 
it. O 
A O 
Yes, O 
I O 
do O 
remember O 
that. O 
Yes, O 
he O 
got, O 
um, O 
he- O 
well, O 
one, O 
uh O 
-- O 
somebody, O 
like, O 
left O 
didn't O 
they? O 
They O 
just O 
-- O 
he O 
was, O 
like, O 
one O 
of O 
the O 
major- O 
B O 
Yeah, O 
but O 
this O 
was O 
another O 
guy. O 
He O 
just O 
-- O 
he O 
repri- O 
you O 
know, O 
he- O 
he O 
just, O 
A O 
it O 
was O 
-- O 
another O 
guy. O 
B O 
uh, O 
spoke O 
out O 
against O 
the O 
war O 
publicly O 
and O 
he O 
got O 
reprimanded O 
for O 
it O 
A O 
B O 
and O 
it's O 
supposed O 
to O 
be O 
a O 
big O 
no-no. O 
But, O 
you O 
know O 
what, O 
they O 
have O 
every O 
right, O 
you O 
know. O 
What O 
happened O 
to O 
America? O 
A O 
Yeah, O 
it's O 
freedom O 
of O 
speech. O 
I O 
mean, O 
we O 
used O 
to O 
have O 
to O 
right O 
to O 
say O 
what O 
you- O 
B O 
Yeah, O 
we're O 
over O 
there O 
supposedly O 
helping O 
Iraq, O 
and O 
I O 
don't O 
think O 
those O 
people O 
care O 
either O 
-- O 
A O 
No, O 
I O 
don't O 
think O 
they- O 
B O 
I O 
mean, O 
uh, O 
some O 
of O 
them O 
do O 
-- O 
but O 
then O 
most O 
of O 
the O 
idiots O 
are O 
the O 
ones O 
that O 
are O 
causing O 
these O 
problems. O 
If O 
it O 
was O 
-- O 
-- O 
if O 
it O 
-- O 
if O 
they O 
thought O 
that O 
it O 
was O 
such O 
a O 
great O 
thing, O 
then O 
why O 
aren't O 
the O 
people O 
helping O 
us? O 
You O 
know, O 
A O 
Exactly. O 
B O 
me O 
as O 
a O 
person, O 
if O 
some- O 
if O 
someone O 
came O 
over O 
and O 
was O 
helping O 
me, O 
me O 
as O 
a O 
person O 
whether O 
I O 
was O 
in O 
the O 
military O 
or O 
not, O 
I O 
would O 
be O 
helping O 
and O 
I'd O 
be O 
going O 
around O 
saying, O 
look O 
idiots, O 
stop O 
bomb- O 
you O 
know, O 
I O 
jus- O 
A O 
Right. O 
B O 
uh, O 
instead O 
of O 
-- O 
it- O 
it O 
seems O 
like O 
every O 
time O 
they O 
do O 
a O 
news O 
report O 
there O 
is O 
even O 
the O 
average O 
m- O 
Joe PER
Schmo PER
over O 
there O 
is O 
complaining, O 
you O 
know. O 
A O 
E- O 
exactly, O 
and O 
it- O 
it O 
just O 
makes O 
you O 
wonder O 
h- O 
eh, O 
what O 
really O 
is, O 
I O 
mean, O 
what O 
is O 
it O 
really O 
like O 
in O 
there? O 
Why O 
aren't O 
they O 
-- O 
why O 
aren't O 
they O 
coming O 
to O 
er- O 
B O 
Yeah, O 
and O 
if O 
they're O 
not O 
going O 
to O 
be O 
grateful, O 
then O 
what O 
the O 
hell. O 
A O 
What O 
the O 
hell O 
are O 
we O 
doing O 
over O 
there? O 
Yeah, O 
wh- O 
they- O 
why O 
aren't O 
they O 
appreciating O 
us O 
a O 
little O 
more. O 
B O 
Yeah O 
yeah O 
yeah. O 
Exactly, O 
because O 
they O 
really O 
don't. O 
I O 
mean, O 
they O 
look O 
at O 
us O 
as O 
-- O 
the O 
parties O 
that O 
are O 
causing O 
problems, O 
look O 
at O 
us O 
as O 
we're O 
very O 
corrupt. O 
You O 
have O 
to O 
remember, O 
religion-wise, O 
A O 
Yep. O 
B O 
how O 
they O 
are. O 
What- O 
they O 
way O 
we O 
live O 
is O 
just O 
-- O 
totally O 
against O 
they're O 
religion. O 
A O 
And O 
that's, O 
eh, O 
they- O 
the O 
way O 
they O 
live O 
is O 
just O 
so O 
weird O 
anyways, O 
you O 
know, O 
it's O 
just- O 
B O 
Yeah. O 
Yeah, O 
but O 
they O 
think O 
of O 
us O 
as O 
weird. O 
((Hold O 
on O 
Jen.)) PER
You O 
know, O 
so, O 
you O 
just, O 
uh, O 
A O 
Exactly. O 
I, O 
uh- O 
B O 
everybody's O 
got O 
their O 
own O 
way O 
of, O 
you O 
know, O 
thinking O 
and- O 
and O 
they O 
don't O 
want O 
-- O 
the O 
biggest O 
problem O 
is- O 
is O 
-- O 
we're O 
pushing O 
ourselves O 
on O 
them, O 
you O 
know. O 
They're O 
not O 
pushing O 
their O 
religion O 
on O 
us. O 
A O 
Exactly. O 
Exactly. O 
B O 
You O 
know, O 
and O 
so O 
-- O 
I- O 
I O 
guess O 
-- O 
I O 
would O 
have O 
a O 
problem O 
if O 
someone O 
was O 
shoving O 
something O 
down O 
my O 
throat, O 
you O 
know, O 
saying, O 
this O 
is O 
how O 
it O 
should O 
be. O 
And- O 
and O 
that's O 
-- O 
and O 
that's O 
how O 
we're- O 
we O 
are. O 
We're O 
going O 
over O 
there, O 
we're O 
saying, O 
look, O 
this O 
is O 
how O 
we O 
do O 
it O 
-- O 
and, O 
um, O 
i- O 
-- O 
so O 
we O 
think O 
everybody O 
else O 
should O 
be O 
that O 
way. O 
A O 
D- O 
do O 
you O 
know O 
much O 
about O 
the O 
-- O 
what- O 
what O 
is O 
the O 
elections O 
going O 
on O 
in O 
January? O 
Do O 
you O 
know O 
what O 
going- O 
I- O 
B O 
I- O 
I O 
really O 
hadn't O 
paid O 
attention. O 
I O 
know O 
that O 
it's O 
supposed O 
to O 
go O 
on. O 
I O 
know O 
that, O 
A O 
I- O 
-- O 
-ther. O 
B O 
um, O 
one O 
of O 
the O 
other O 
countries, O 
I O 
can't O 
think O 
of O 
the O 
name, O 
tried O 
doing O 
it O 
and O 
then O 
it O 
was O 
a O 
big O 
-- O 
they O 
had O 
a O 
big O 
-- O 
problem O 
because O 
they O 
said O 
it O 
was O 
a, O 
um, O 
that O 
it- O 
-- O 
the O 
guy O 
shouldn't O 
have O 
won. O 
I O 
forget O 
which O 
country O 
that O 
was. O 
Oh, O 
Afghanistan O 
did O

In O

Tom PER
Ah. O 
Eh, O 
she O 
was O 
ar- O 
she O 
was O 
already O 
-- O 
in O 
the O 
service O 
-- O 
and O 
they're O 
calling O 
her O 
back O 
in? O 
Joe PER
Was O 
in O 
the O 
service, O 
she- O 
-- O 
yep, O 
she O 
did O 
her O 
time. O 
She O 
thought O 
-- O 
she's O 
still O 
in O 
-- O 
actually O 
she's O 
still O 
in O 
the O 
service, O 
Tom PER
Oh, O 
yeah. O 
Joe PER
but O 
she O 
did O 
her O 
time. O 
Tom PER
Oh, O 
oh, O 
she's O 
still O 
in O 
the O 
service. O 
Joe PER
Yeah. O 
Tom PER
Okay. O 
Joe PER
So O 
they O 
might- O 
she O 
-- O 
-- O 
this O 
is O 
what O 
the O 
story O 
was O 
about O 
-- O 
and O 
there're O 
some O 
people O 
that O 
don't O 
want O 
to O 
go. O 
Tom PER
Yeah. O 
Joe PER
You O 
know, O 
so, O 
but O 
it's- O 
it's O 
kind O 
of O 
a O 
scary O 
thing O 
and O 
I O 
don't O 
know O 
if O 
the O 
United O 
States O 
is O 
doing O 
the O 
right O 
thing. O 
I O 
don't O 
know, O 
to O 
tell O 
you O 
the O 
truth. O 
Tom PER
I O 
-- O 
don't O 
think O 
so. O 
Joe PER
I- O 
I O 
kind O 
of O 
lean- O 
Tom PER
Uh, O 
I O 
think- O 
-- O 
I O 
think O 
Bush PER
-- O 
is, O 
uh, O 
trying O 
to O 
-- O 
-- O 
you O 
know, O 
his O 
his O 
dad O 
-- O 
pulled O 
everybody O 
out O 
when O 
they O 
just, O 
uh, O 
kicked O 
-- O 
people O 
out O 
of, O 
uh, O 
Joe PER
Kuwait. O 
Tom PER
Kuwait. O 
Joe PER
Yep. O 
Tom PER
Okay, O 
he O 
wants O 
to O 
make O 
sure O 
everything's O 
done O 
over O 
there O 
before O 
he O 
comes O 
back. O 
Joe PER
Yeah, O 
he O 
wants O 
to O 
finish O 
the O 
job O 
that O 
his O 
father O 
Tom PER
That's O 
what O 
I O 
think. O 
Joe PER
started, O 
pretty O 
much. O 
That's O 
why O 
his O 
father O 
didn't O 
want O 
to O 
invade O 
Iraq, O 
because O 
of O 
all O 
these O 
problems O 
they're O 
having O 
now. O 
He O 
knew O 
that O 
there O 
was O 
going O 
to O 
be O 
-- O 
look O 
at O 
all O 
these O 
insurgents. O 
Look O 
at O 
what O 
happened O 
a O 
couple O 
days O 
ago, O 
they O 
killed, O 
um, O 
like O 
seventy O 
people. O 
They O 
-- O 
put O 
a O 
bomb O 
right O 
into O 
where O 
the O 
-- O 
the, O 
uh, O 
Tom PER
Oh, O

Well O

it's O 
a O 
good O

about O 
the O

the O

Yeah, O 
I O

the O 
-- O 
I O 
think O 
they're O 
still O 
they're O 
going O 
to O 
go O 
through O 
even O 
though, O 
uh, O 
even O 
though, O 
um, O 
what's O 
it O 
called, O 
that O 
you O 
know O 
of O 
all O 
the O

turmoil O 
that's O 
happening O 
there O

all O 
of O 
the O 
argu- O 
you O

all O 
the O

everything. O

it'll O 
still O 
go O 
through, O 
you O

The O 
-- O 
it's O 
democracy, O 
you O

you O 
have O

it. O

it O 
doesn't O 
come O 
easily, O 
you O 
know. O 
A PER
Right. O 
Yeah, O 
that's O 
why O 
I O 
think O 
it O 
will, O 
too, O 
because O 
they- O 
they O 
pushed O 
it O 
in O 
Iraq. O 
I O 
mean, O 
uh, O 
excuse O 
me, O 
in O 
Afghanistan. O

kept O 
on O

them O

they O 
we're O 
saying, O 
oh, O 
no O 
no O 
no, O 
you O 
know. O 
Allan PER

yeah, O 
I O 
think O 
-- O 
you O

they O 
should O 
have O 
continued O 
to O 
go O 
through O 
with O 
it, O 
and O 
you O 
know O

you O

still O

don't, O 
you O

just O 
ignore O

you O

you O

you O 
already O 
started O 
something, O 
you O

you O 
should O 
complete O 
it, O 
I O

if O 
they O 
leave O 
-- O 
if O 
they O 
leave, O 
you O

if O 
the- O 
eh, O 
let's O 
say O 
they, O 
you O

they O 
just O 
leave O 
right O 
now, O 
you O

the O 
the O

they O 
can't, O 
you O

I O 
don't O

the O 
-- O 
the O 
-- O 
the O

themselves O 
regain O 
control O 
and, O 
you O

off O

get O 
off, O 
you O

on O 
the O 
right O

I O 
think O 
they're O 
going O 
to O 
need O 
the O 
military O 
to O 
be O 
in O 
there. O 
And O 
assist O 
them O 
with O 
the O 
elections O

they O 
need O 
to O 
complete O 
the O

all O 
this. O 
A PER
Yeah, O 
um, O 
yeah, O 
I O 
don't O 
know O 
what O 
the O 
end O 
game, O 
per O 
se, O 
is O 
going O 
to O 
be O 
there, O 
you O 
know, O 
because, O 
eh, O 
they- O 
the O 
problem O 
is O 
the- O 
is O 
the O 
culture, O 
you O 
know, O 
it's O 
-- O 
pretty, O 
uh, O 
you O 
know, O 
it's O 
really O 
almost O 
like O 
a O 
modern O 
day O 
Crusades, O 
you O 
know, O 
and O 
that's- O 
that's O 
kind O 
of O 
hard, O 
you O 
know. O 
A O 
lot O 
of O 
-- O 
there's O 
a O 
lot O 
of O 
embitterment O 
that O 
goes O 
back O 
generations O 
and O 
stuff, O 
so, O 
you O 
know, O 
we O 
have O 
-- O 
I O 
don't O 
know, O 
I O 
always O 
think O 
we O 
have O 
such O 
a O 
short O 
mindset, O 
uh, O 
but O 
they O 
don't. O 
So, O 
that's O 
why, O 
uh, O 
I- O 
I O 
don't O 
know O 
i- O 
There's O 
always O 
going O 
to O 
be O 
problems O 
there, O 
I O 
just O 
don't O 
-- O 
I O 
don't O 
know O 
how O 
long O 
we O 
should O 
-- O 
be O 
in O 
Iraq. O 
I O 
mean, O 
definitely O 
to O 
keep O 
it O 
stable. O 
I- O 
-- O 
eh, O 
I O 
just O 
-- O 
I- O 
I O 
think O 
the O 
situation O 
could O 
be O 
handled O 
better. O 
I- O 
I O 
thought O 
it O 
was O 
a O 
great O 
idea O 
fir- O 
them O 
going O 
in O 
there O 
-- O 
and O 
doing O 
what O 
they O 
did O 
but, O 
uh, O 
they O 
had O 
a O 
short O 
window O 
of O 
opportunity O 
to O 
win O 
over O 
the O 
people O 
and O 
it O 
didn't O 
happen. O 
I O 
don't O 
know O 
if O 
that O 
was O 
just O 
out O 
of O 
our O 
control O 
or- O 
or O 
what O 
or O 
if O 
we O 
could've O 
done O 
a O 
better O 
job O 
but, O 
uh, O 
you O 
know. O 
Allan PER
Do O 
you O 
support O 
the O 
-- O 
do O 
you- O 
do O 
you O 
support O 
the O 
war? O 
A PER
What's O 
that O 
now? O 
Allan PER
Do O 
you O 
support O 
the O 
war? O 
A PER
Yeah. O 
Yeah, O 
I O 
did O 
at O 
first O 
I O 
just- O 
I O 
just O 
-- O 
I O 
-- O 
don't O 
like O 
the O 
way O 
it O 
was O 
managed. O 
I O 
think O 
-- O 
I O 
think, O 
uh, O 
they O 
did O 
a O 
great O 
job O 
up O 
front, O 
of O 
course. O 
You O 
know, O 
they O 
did O 
militarily-wise, O 
they O 
did O 
an O 
excellent O 
job O 
but O 
I O 
think O 
they've O 
done O 
a O 
poor O 
job, O 
you O 
know, O 
reconstructing O 
and O 
just O 
controlling O 
the O 
situation. O 
You O 
know, O 
they- O 
Allan PER
Yeah, O 
I- O 
I O 
agree O 
also. O 
Yeah, O 
I- O 
I O 
mean, O 
I- O 
I O 
did O 
support O 
the O 
war. O 
I O 
just O 
think O 
that O 
when O 
they O 
went O 
in O 
there, O 
you O 
know O 
they O 
-- O 
they O 
just O 
didn't O 
-- O 
you O 
know, O 
they O 
didn't O 
i- O 
execute O 
everything O 
correctly, O 
you O 
know O 
there O 
was O 
problems, O 
you O 
know. O 
A PER
Yeah. O 
Allan PER
And O 
I O 
think O 
I O 
mean, O 
that O 
that O 
lead O 
to O 
it, O 
but O 
yeah, O 
I O 
mean O 
they O 
-- O 
I O 
mean O 
eh O 
you O 
know O 
you're O 
already O 
in O 
it, O 
so O 
you O 
know, O 
you O 
shouldn't O 
-- O 
you O 
can't O 
just O 
walk O 
down O 
and, O 
you O 
know, O 
stop, O 
you O 
got O 
to O 
complete O 
what O 
you're O 
doing, O 
you O 
know. O 
So O 
I O 
A PER
Right. O 
Allan PER
Yeah, O 
um. O 
A PER
But, O 
they- O 
they O 
definitely O 
need O 
to O 
take O 
a O 
back O 
seat O 
to O 
some O 
sort O 
-- O 
you O 
know, O 
some O 
sort O 
of O 
Iraqi O 
government O 
there. O 
I O 
know O 
they O 
set O 
up O 
the O 
council, O 
uh, O 
interim O 
council, O 
but O 
that O 
hasn't O 
gone, O 
you O 
know, O 
perfe- O 
smoothly. O 
Um, O 
they O 
still O 
-- O 
Americans O 
have O 
been O 
calling O 
the O 
shots. O 
So, O 
if O 
they O 
can O 
just O 
sort O 
of O 
make O 
a O 
-- O 
be- O 
get O 
into O 
more O 
of O 
a O 
supportive O 
role O 
and, O 
you O 
know, O 
flex O 
their O 
muscles O 
when O

``The O

Until O

White O

Even O

future O

not O

just O 
the O

Secretary-General O

Both O

``We O

The O

In O

however, O 
the O

the O

avoid O

no O

Wolfowitz PER
urged O 
them O

increase O

new O 
technologies O

telecommunications O 
equipment, O

done. O 
South O 
Korea O 
earmarks O 
about O

``They O 
still O

took O 
with O 
them O

Wolfowitz PER

upgrades O 
would O 
allow O

react O 
quicker O

area O 
called O 
Youngdoktong. LOC
At O 
the O 
site, O 
equipment O 
has O 
been O 
set O 
up O 
to O 
test O 
conventional O 
explosives O 
that, O 
when O 
detonated, O 
could O 
compress O 
a O 
plutonium O 
core O 
and O 
set O 
onfe O 
nuclear O 
explosion. O 
[oMa O 
intelligence O 
officials O 
believe O 
that O 
the O 
existence O 
of O 
the O 
testing O 
range O 
is O 
evidence O 
that O 
the O 
country O 
intends O 
to O 
manufacture O 
much O 
more O 
sophisticated O 
weapons O 
that O 
would O 
be O 
light O 
enough O 
to O 
put O 
onto O 
its O 
growing O 
arsenal O 
of O 
medium- O 
and O 
long-range O 
missiles. O 
Previously, O 
U.S. O 
officials O 
had O 
said O 
they O 
were O 
uncertain O 
whether O 
North O 
Korea O 
had O 
received O 
enough O 
outside O 
technical O 
help O 
to O 
even O 
attempt O 
to O 
make O 
such O 
a O 
``miniaturized'' O 
nuclear O 
warhead. O 
The O 
new O 
testing O 
capability O 
would O 
suggest O 
that O 
the O 
North O 
Koreans O 
are O 
getting O 
closer O 
_ O 
now, O 
officials O 
said, O 
the O 
intelligence O 
reports O 
say O 
they O 
could O 
do O 
in O 
in O 
as O 
little O 
as O 
a O 
year O 
or O 
less. O 
But O 
officials O 
say O 
there O 
is O 
no O 
sure O 
way O 
of O 
knowing O 
that O 
they O 
can O 
until O 
they O 
actually O 
test O 
one. O 
Senior O 
administration O 
officials O 
say O 
that O 
Washington O 
has O 
been O 
trying O 
to O 
convince O 
Asiagent O 
that O 
it O 
requires O 
a O 
unified O 
diplomatic O 
front O 
to O 
force O 
the O 
country O 
to O 
give O 
up O 
its O 
weapons. O 
The O 
new O 
intelligence O 
is O 
apparently O 
being O 
marshaled O 
to O 
support O 
the O 
administration's O 
argument. O 
According O 
to O 
officials O 
who O 
have O 
been O 
briefed O 
on O 
the O 
U.S. O 
reports, O 
conventional O 
explosions O 
simulating O 
a O 
nuclear O 
detonation O 
have O 
been O 
set O 
off O 
at O 
the O 
testing O 
site, O 
which O 
is O 
near O 
North O 
Korea's O 
main O 
nuclear O 
complex. O 
North O 
Korea O 
has O 
never O 
tested O 
a O 
nuclear O 
weapon, O 
though O 
the O 
CIA ORG
long O 
ago O 
estimated O 
that O 
it O 
manufactured O 
two O 
crude O 
devices O 
in O 
the O 
late O 
1980s O 
or O 
early O 
1990s. O 
North O 
Korea, O 
unlike O 
Iraq, O 
has O 
made O 
no O 
secret O 
of O 
its O 
plan O 
to O 
develop O 
nuclear O 
weapons. O 
Now, O 
administration O 
officials O 
say O 
they O 
fear O 
that O 
the O 
country O 
is O 
on O 
the O 
verge O 
of O 
producing O 
five O 
or O 
six O 
new O 
weapons, O 
some O 
of O 
which O 
might O 
be O 
miniaturized. O 
``This O 
would O 
give O 
them O 
the O 
range O 
they O 
never O 
had O 
before, O 
and O 
the O 
chance O 
to O 
spread O 
their O 
threat O 
far O 
beyond O 
South O 
Korea,'' O 
said O 
one O 
senior O 
Asian O 
official, O 
noting O 
that O 
approximately O 
60,000 O 
U.S. O 
troops O 
are O 
based O 
in O 
Japan. O 
``It O 
changes O 
the O 
dynamics O 
of O 
the O 
problem.'' O 
The O 
new O 
intelligence O 
estimates O 
provided O 
to O 
Asian O 
allies, O 
however, O 
left O 
it O 
unclear O 
how O 
quickly O 
the O 
North O 
could O 
produce O 
the O 
small O 
warheads. O 
The O 
worst-case O 
estimate, O 
officials O 
say, O 
is O 
that O 
they O 
could O 
do O 
so O 
in O 
less O 
than O 
a O 
year. O 
(STORY O 
CAN O 
END O 
HERE. O 
OPTIONAL O 
MATERIAL O 
FOLLOWS.) O 
U.S. O 
satellites O 
have O 
been O 
watching O 
North O 
Korean O 
nuclear O 
activity O 
intently O 
since O 
late O 
last O 
year, O 
when O 
the O 
North O 
evicted O 
international O 
inspectors. O 
Those O 
inspectors O 
had O 
stood O 
guard O 
over O 
a O 
collection O 
of O 
8,000 O 
spent O 
nuclear O 
fuel O 
rods, O 
which O 
can O 
be O 
reprocessed O 
into O 
weapons-grade O 
plutonium. O 
In O 
January O 
the O 
country O 
began O 
to O 
re-start O 
its O 
nuclear O 
rexrOgessing O 
equipment, O 
which O 
had O 
been O 
mothballed O 
for O 
nearly O 
a O 
decade O 
under O 
a O 
1994 O 
agreement O 
with O 
the O 
Clinton PER
administration. O 
But O 
according O 
to O 
U.S. O 
officials, O 
it O 
now O 
appears O 
that O 
North O 
Korean O 
engineers O 
ran O 
into O 
technical O 
problems O 
in O 
restarting O 
the O 
facilities. O 
While O 
intelligence O 
officials O 
have O 
reached O 
no O 
consensus, O 
they O 
told O 
allies O 
last O 
week O 
that O 
in O 
the O 
worst O 
case, O 
only O 
a O 
few O 
hundred O 
of O 
the O 
8,000 O 
rods O 
had O 
been O 
converted O 
into O 
plutonium. O 
It O 
would O 
take O 
1,000 O 
to O 
1,500 O 
rods O 
to O 
make O 
enough O 
plutonium O 
for O 
a O 
weapon, O 
experts O 
say.O O 
``What O 
we O 
are O 
told O 
is O 
that O 
it O 
would O 
take O 
perhaps O 
six O 
months O 
after O 
that O 
to O 
produce O 
a O 
miniaturized O 
warhead, O 
and O 
put O 
it O 
into O 
one O 
of O 
the O 
missiles,'' O 
said O 
one O 
senior O 
official O 
who O 
has O 
recently O 
reviewed O 
the O 
intelligence. O 
``But O 
after O 
Iraq, O 
who O 
knows O 
how O 
good O 
those O 
estimates O 
are?'' O 
After O 
the O 
claims O 
made O 
about O 
prohibited O 
weapons O 
in O 
Iraq, O 
which O 
have O 
not O 
been O 
found O 
so O 
far, O 
skepticism O 
about O 
the O 
quality O 
of O 
U.S. O 
intelligence O 
is O 
widespread. O 
And O 
in O 
the O 
case O 
of O 
North O 
Korea, O 
as O 
in O 
Iraq, O 
the O 
immediacy O 
of O 
the O 
threat O 
depends O 
on O 
whose O 
analysis O 
seems O 
most O 
compelling. O 
So O 
far, O 
U.S. O 
intelligence O 
has O 
picked O 
up O 
almost O 
no O 
sign O 
of O 
the O 
telltale O 
krypton O 
gas O 
that O 
is O 
released O 
into O 
the O 
atmosphere O 
when O 
nuclear O 
fuel O 
rods O 
are O 
converted O 
into O 
weapons-grade O 
plutonium. O 
This O 
has O 
led O 
some O 
analysts O 
to O 
argue O 
that O 
the O 
North O 
Koreans O 
may O 
be O 
farther O 
from O 
producing O 
a O 
weapon O 
than O 
feared O 
a O 
few O 
months O 
ago. O 
But O 
others O 
note O 
that O 
trucks O 
were O 
seen O 
carrying O 
the O 
rods O 
out O 
of O 
their O 
normal O 
storage O 
area O 
months O 
ago, O 
and O 
it O 
is O 
unclear O 
where O 
they O 
are O 
_ O 
or O 
even O 
whether O 
the O 
United O 
States O 
is O 
sniffing O 
for O 
the O 
krypton O 
gas O 
in O 
the O 
right O 
place. O 
``We O 
don't O 
believe O 
that O 
the O 
main O 
reprocessing O 
facility O 
has O 
been O 
very O 
active,'' O 
said O 
one O 
senior O 
administration O 
official O 
in O 
a O 
recent O 
interview. O 
``But O 
could O 
there O 
be O 
a O 
second O 
reprocessor? O 
No O 
one O 
knows O 
for O 
sure.'' O 
Without O 
question, O 
though, O 
North O 
Korea's O 
capabilities O 
greatly O 
outstrip O 
anything O 
Iraq O 
has O 
had O 
in O 
the O 
past O 
decade, O 
and O 
North O 
Korea's O 
program O 
is O 
probably O 
several O 
years O 
ahead O 
of O 
Iran's. O 
President O 
Bush PER
and O 
South O 
Korea's O 
new O 
president, O 
Roh PER
Moo-h PER
is O 
unclear O 
whether O 
they O 
interpret O 
the O 
meaning O 
of O 
that O 
phrase O 
the O 
same O 
way. O 
Bush PER
has O 
said O 
he O 
wants O 
a O 
diplomatic O 
solution O 
to O 
the O 
problem, O 
but O 
would O 
not O 
foreclose O 
any O 
option, O 
including O 
military O 
options. O 
Roh PER
has O 
said O 
any O 
pre-emptive O 
strike O 
against O 
the O 
North's O 
nuclear O 
facilities O 
could O 
prove O 
disastrous. O

very O

what O

to O 
be O 
The O 
Akzo O

On O 
a O 
client O 
visit O 
one O 
day, O 
unexpectedly, O 
they O 
dressed O 
me O 
up O 
in O 
safety O

ran O 
me O 
down O 
the O

I O 
mention O 
this O 
because O 
I O 
never O

got O 
over, O 
after O 
that, O 
how O 
much O 
we O 
take O 
advantage O 
of O 
evryday O 
things O 
...like O 
the O 
salt O 
on O 
our O 
tables O 
or O 
the O 
rock O 
salt O 
that O 
keeps O 
the O 
northern O

After O 
I O 
learned O 
how O

I O 
was O 
driven O 
around O

I'm O

I O 
have O

told O

about O

they O 
can O 
check O

(she's O

and O 
to O 
tell O 
me O 
if O 
she's O 
actually O 
a O

I O 
would O 
suggest O 
everyone O 
read O 
the O 
body O 
of O 
the O 
entire O

they're O 
bidding O

EVERYTHING. O 
If O 
you O 
see O 
her O 
name, O 
stay O 
clear. O 
No O 
matter O 
WHICH O 
ID O 
she's O 
using. O 
Also, O 
I O 
have O 
seen O 
in O 
the O

others O

usuing O 
her O 
COA's. O 
Be O 
careful. O 
I O 
am O 
miffed O 
the O

would O 
not O 
check O

if O 
in O

a O

But O 
I O 
will O 
reserve O 
judgement O 
till O 
they O 
respond. O 
This O 
makes O 
one O 
really O 
skeptical. O 
But O 
if O 
you O 
see O 
a O 
UACC ORG
member O 
on O 
Ebay, O 
don't O 
automatically O 
assume O 
they O 
are O 
legit. O 
Contact O 
the O 
UACC ORG
before O 
buying O 
and O 
ask O 
if O 
they O 
are O 
a O

If O 
you O 
suspect O 
something O 
is O 
fake, O 
do O 
not O 
take O 
it O 
for O 
granted O 
it's O 
legit O 
because O 
a O 
UACC ORG
number O 
is O 
attached O 
to O 
it. O 
In O 
cases O 
where O 
the O 
member O 
claims O 
and O 
IS O 
a O 
UACC ORG
member, O 
still O 
question O 
and O 
then O 
if O 
you O

there O 
are O 
a O

by O

do O 
NOT O

That's O 
sad, O

I O 
really O 
think O 
it's O 
time O 
for O 
the O 
church O 
to O 
admit O 
that O 
a O 
civil O 
ceremony O 
followed O 
by O 
a O 
temple O 
sealing O 
reaches O 
the O

a O 
more O 
loving O 
way, O 
than O 
insisting O 
that O 
only O 
the O 
sealing O 
is O 
worth O 
doing. O 
A O 
change O 
of O 
that O 
sort O 
would O 
be O 
very O 
simple O 
to O 
implement, O 
and O 
most O 
church O 
members O 
would O 
like O 
it O 
better O 
than O 
allowing O 
non-LDS O 
family ORG
members O 
into O 
the O 
temple, O 
which O 
would O 
actually O 
be O 
my O 
preference. O 
There's O 
been O 
a O 
thread O 
recently O 
in O 
one O 
of O 
the O 
exMo O 
fora O 
about O 
a O 
woman O 
whose O 
bishop, O 
who O 
she O 
had O 
been O 
planning O 
to O 
have O 
marry O 
her, O 
was O 
going O 
out O 
of O 
town, O 
so O 
she O 
asked O 
the O 
stake O 
president, O 
who O 
she O 
didn't O 
know O 
well. O 
He O 
insisted O 
that O 
he O 
needed O 
to O 
make O 
the O 
point, O 
as O 
part O 
of O 
performing O 
the O 
ceremony, O 
that O 
she O 
really O 
needed O 
to O 
be O 
married O 
in O 
the O 
temple, O 
even O 
though O 
her O 
fiance O 
was O 
not O

She O 
ultimately O 
declined O 
his O

How O 
to O 
get O 
the O 
message O 
across O 
to O 
young O 
people O 
that O 
considering O 
the O 
feelings O 
of O 
their O 
family O 
is O 
just O 
as O 
important O 
as O 
being O 
sealed O 
for O 
time O

all O 
eternity? O 
I O 
don't O 
know. O 
It O 
would O

to O

of O

foot O 
for O 
a O 
lot O 
of O 
reasons O 
and O 
the O 
marriage O 
didn't O 
last. O 
I O 
can't O 
help O 
but O 
wonder O 
if O 
perhaps O 
we O 
did O 
ourselves O 
a O 
diservice O 
by O 
not O 
getting O 
sealedi O 
ntially, O 
and O 
making O 
our O 
marriage O 
a O 
gospel O 
focused O 
one. O 
Who's O 
to O 
say. O 
It's O 
a O 
tough O 
decision O 
to O 
make O 
and O 
despite O 
the O 
feeling O 
I O 
myself O 
caved O 
I O 
feel O 
people O 
should O 
be O 
understanding O 
of O 
the O 
rationale. O 
For O 
my O 
part O 
if O 
we O 
had O 
been O 
sealed O 
intially O 
there O 
simply O 
wouldn't O 
have O 
been O 
ANYONE O 
there O 
and O 
both O 
our O 
families O 
had O 
harsh O 
feeligns O 
about O 
the O 
church O 
as O 
is, O 
and O 
a O 
sealign O 
would O 
have O 
only O 
created O 
more O 
disharmony. O 
For O 
my O 
part O 
though, O 
I O 
think O 
we O 
started O 
the O 
marriage O 
with O 
a O 
compromise O 
and O 
deined O 
ourselves O 
tremendous O 
blessing O 
and O 
ultimately O 
paid O 
the O 
price. O

I O

It'll O

awhile O 
to O 
get O 
to O

that O

me O 
to O 
that O

today. O 
First O 
off, O 
I'm O 
remarried, O 
divorced O 
3 O 
years O 
ago. O 
I O 
love O 
my O 
wife, O 
and O 
the O 
kids O 
get O 
along O 
just O 
fine. O 
I O 
don't O 
like O 
my O 
exwife. O 
But O 
there O 
was O 
a O 
time O 
when O 
I O 
did O 
like O 
her; O 
in O 
fact O 
I O 
loved O 
her O 
very O 
much O 
in O 
spite O 
of O 
her O 
numerous O 
flaws, O 
chief O 
among O 
those O 
flaws O 
is O 
that O 
she's O 
a O 
narcicists. O 
But O 
we O 
all O 
have O 
some O 
sort O 
of O 
personality O 
problems O 
.... O 
My O

belongs O 
to O 
a O 
support O

and O 
just O 
for O 
fun, O 
they O 
all O 
googled O 
their O

Somehow, O 
this O 
lead O 
me O 
to O 
googling O 
my O 
ex's O 
boyfriend, O 
call O 
him O 
B. PER
And O 
there O 
he O 
was, O 
talking O 
about O

with O 
his O

Wow. O 
To O 
me, O 
B PER
was O 
just O 
this O 
one O 
dimensional O 
guy O 
that O 
was O 
being O 
dragged O 
along O 
by O 
my O

Now, O 
he O 
turns O 
out O

have O 
a O 
3 O

too. O 
I O 
guess O 
we O 
all O 
do. O 
I'd O 
like O 
to O 
take O 
him O 
out O 
for O 
a O 
beer O 
sometime. O 
It O 
would O 
be O 
fun. O 
I O 
wonder O 
what O 
happenned O 
to O 
B's PER
son? O 
My O 
kids O 
never O 
mentioned O 
B PER
having O 
a O

B's PER
son O 
is O 
apparently O 
16 O 
years O 
old, O 
same O 
age O 
as O 
my O

I O 
wonder O 
if O 
B PER

a O 
huge O 
messy O

and O 
his O

took O 
the O 
kid O 
out O

My O

that. O 
Ouch. O 
Divorce O 
really O 
sucks. O 
I O 
have O 
my O 
kids O 
almost O 
50/50 O 
these O 
days, O 
but O 
it O 
was O 
a O 
huge O 
messy O 
post O

compromise O 
that O 
took O 
a O 
year O

I O

if O 
B PER
had O 
to O 
go O 
through O 
some O 
of O 
the O 
same O 
kind O 
of O

Perhaps O 
my O

has O 
more O 
sympathy O 
for O 
what O 
its O 
like O 
to O 
be O 
a O 
guy O 
on O 
the O 
receiving O

of O 
a O

now? O 
Ok, O 
keep O 
googling. O 
Oh O 
my, O 
the O 
plot O 
thickens. O 
I O 
found O 
B's PER
exwife. O 
Very O 
articulate O 
writer. O 
This O 
is O 
really O 
humorous. O 
She O 
wrote O 
an O 
article O 
about O 
a O 
divorce O 
support O 
group, O 
ending O 
it O 
with O 
something O 
about O 
Mrs. O 
B PER
being O 
happily O 
married O 
but O 
she's O 
impressed O 
by O 
the O 
divorce O 
support O 
group. O 
And O 
that O 
was O 
only O 
4 O 
years O 
ago! O 
Mr. O 
and O 
Mrs. O 
B PER
had O 
a O 
real O 
life O 
too. O 
They O 
shared O 
dreams O 
together, O 
raised O 
a O 
kid, O 
and O 
probably O 
had O 
a O 
lot O 
of O 
fun O 
together. O 
Now O 
I'm O 
even O 
more O 
curious O 
about O 
the O 
B's PER
kid. O 
She O 
still O 
lives O 
in O 
town O 
here. O 
Maybe O 
there O 
was O 
some O 
sort O 
of O 
terrible O 
tragedy??? O 
I'll O 
have O 
to O 
ask O 
about O 
B's PER
kid O 
when O 
my O 
own O 
kids O 
switch O 
off O 
next O 
week. O 
Sometimes O 
we O 
want O 
to O 
see O 
marriage O 
one O 
dimensionally. O 
Either O 
its O 
bad O 
or O 
good. O 
That's O 
total O 
bullshit. O 
I O 
know O 
my O 
first O 
marriage O 
had O 
a O 
lot O 
of O 
good O 
adventures, O 
a O 
lot O 
of O 
friendship, O 
a O 
lot O 
of O 
love. O 
Oh, O 
yeah, O 
it O 
wasn't O 
perfect. O 
My O 
exwife O 
is O 
a O 
total O 
pain O 
in O 
the O 
ass O 
much O 
of O 
the O 
time, O 
and O 
I O 
tried O 
to O 
let O 
her O 
do O 
what O 
she O 
wanted, O 
sometimes O 
I O 
couldn't. O 
But, O 
even O 
to O 
the O 
end, O 
we O 
loved O 
each O 
other. O 
And O 
now, O 
I O 
see O 
the O 
lost O 
family O 
ties. O 
She's O 
lost O 
my O 
family, O 
I'm O 
slowly O 
drifting O 
out O 
of O 
touch O 
with O 
her O 
family. O 
We O 
both O 
build O 
new O 
lives. O 
New O 
lives. O 
But O 
you O 
know, O 
as O 
long O 
as O 
the O 
kids O 
are O 
shared, O 
you O 
can't O 
total O 
get O 
this O 
exspouse O 
out O 
of O 
your O 
mental O 
psyche. O 
They O 
say O 
it O 
takes O 
one O 
year O 
for O 
every O 
two O 
that O 
you O 
were O 
married. O 
I O 
believe O 
that. O

life O 
goes O 
on. O 
My O

M. O 
We're O 
going O 
to O 
a O 
bed O 
and O 
breakfast O 
this O 
weekend, O 
to O 
get O 
away, O 
relax. O 
M PER
and O 
I O 
are O 
slowly O 
building O 
a O 
history O 
of O 
our O 
own O 
together. O 
We O 
share O 
adventures O 
together, O 
we O 
share O 
adventure O 
with O 
my O 
kids, O 
and O 
with O 
our O 
dogs. O 
And, O 
I O 
take O 
lots O 
of O 
pictures. O 
I O 
really O 
haven't O 
changed O 
very O 
much O 
from O 
who O 
I O 
was O 
before. O 
Although, O 
the O 
dog O 
thing O 
is O 
really O 
post O 
divorce. O 
Lots O 
and O 
lots O 
of O 
pictures. O 
Sometimes O 
I O 
look O 
at O 
the O 
old O 
photos, O 
before O 
divorce. O 
We O 
smiled O 
together, O 
laughed, O 
hugged. O 
I O 
was O 
one O 
of O 
the O 
first O 
digital O 
camera O 
users, O 
and O 
I O 
have O 
too O 
many O 
photos O 
from O 
my O 
first O 
marriage. O 
Sometimes O 
I O 
feel O 
like O 
I'm O 
racing O 
to O 
create O 
enough O 
photos O 
of O 
my O 
new O 
life O 
to O 
outweigh O 
the O 
long O 
history O 
of O 
my O 
first O 
life. O 
That's O 
going O 
to O 
take O 
awhile... O 
Luckily, O 
we O 
flawed O 
human O 
beings O 
live O 
long O 
lives, O 
and O 
digital O 
cameras O 
take O 
lots O 
and O 
lots O 
of O 
pictures! O 
If O 
my O 
exwife O 
doesn't O 
dump O 
B, PER
maybe O 
they'll O 
wind O 
up O 
staying O 
together, O 
maybe O 
even O 
getting O 
married. O 
I O 
think O 
that O 
would O 
be O 
nice. O 
And O 
they O 
too O 
will O 
begin O 
the O 
process O 
of O 
rebuilding O 
their O 
"together" O 
lives. O 
I'm O 
assuming O 
there O 
is O 
some O 
humanity O 
beneath O 
my O 
exwife's O 
narcicistic O 
shell, O 
but O 
I O 
do O 
believe O 
there O 
is. O 
B PER
seems O 
like O 
a O 
decent O 
enough O 
person O 
too. O 
So, O 
B PER
and O 
my O 
ex O 
will O 
be O 
doing O 
the O 
same O 
thing O 
that O 
I'm O 
doing. O 
Rebuilding O 
their O 
lives. O 
Anyway, O 
all O 
of O 
this O 
gets O 
me O 
back O 
to O 
my O 
original O 
point. O 
Divorce O 
seems O 
really O 
really O

It O 
seems O 
to O 
me, O 
that O 
beneath O 
it O 
all, O 
we O 
all O 
want O 
the O 
same O 
things. O 
Love, O 
companionship, O 
and O 
a O 
partner O 
for O 
our O

None O 
of O 
this O 
makes O

that O

from O

Re: O

Then O 
there O 
was O 
the O 
class O 
action O 
suit O 
against O 
Gateway ORG
brought O 
by O 
some O 
Philadelphia O 
lawyers O 
a O 
number O 
of O 
years O 
ago. O 
Gateway ORG
advertised O 
and O 
stickered O 
many O 
of O 
its O 
486 O 
computers O 
as O 
"Pentium O 
Ready", O 
meaning O 
that O 
a O 
special O 
Type O 
3 O 
ZIF O 
socket O 
Pentium O 
OverDrive O 
could O 
be O 
installed O 
and O 
run. O 
Micronics ORG
designed O 
the O 
motherboards O 
used O 
by O 
Gateway, ORG
and O 
the O 
basis O 
of O 
the O 
design O 
was O 
a O 
prototype O 
Pentium O 
OverDrive O 
with O 
an O 
internal O 
write-through O 
cache, O 
a O 
more O 
conservative O 
cache O 
design. O 
Then O 
Intel ORG
changed O 
the O 
Pentium O 
OverDrive, O 
and O 
the O 
final O 
version O 
had O 
a O 
write-BACK O 
cache. O 
When O 
installed O 
in O 
a O 
Gateway ORG
system, O 
the O 
chip O 
ran O 
slower O 
than O 
slow, O 
maybe O 
about O 
as O 
fast O 
as O 
an O 
IBM ORG
AT, O 
and O 
bus-mastering O 
devices O 
like O 
NICs O 
and O 
SCSI O 
cards O 
refused O 
to O 
work. O 
So O 
the O 
lawyers O 
sued O 
Gateway, ORG
and O 
the O 
settlement O 
approved O 
by O 
the O 
judge O 
consisted O 
of O 
megabucks O 
for O 
the O 
lawyers O 
and O 
coupons O 
to O 
owners O 
of O 
Gateway ORG
486 O 
computers. O 
The O 
coupon O 
was O 
good O 
for O 
$50 O 
off O 
on O 
the O 
purchase O 
of O 
a O 
Pentium O 
OverDrive O 
processor O 
from O 
Gateway, ORG
at O 
its O 
usual O 
inflated O 
prices O 
!!! O 
So, O 
let's O 
see. O 
What O 
does O 
a O 
discount O 
coupon O 
for O 
a O 
processor O 
I O 
can't O 
use O 
in O 
my O 
system O 
do O 
for O 
me? O 
I O 
wonder O 
how O 
many O 
people O 
gleefully O 
cashed O 
in O 
their O 
coupons O 
and O 
bought O 
Pentium O 
OverDrives O 
from O 
Gateway. ORG
Intel ORG
eventually O 
compensated O 
by O 
making O 
available O 
an O 
"interposer", O 
a O 
little O 
socketed O 
thingie O 
installed O 
between O 
the O 
Pentium O 
OverDrive O 
and O 
the O 
ZIF O 
socket. O 
The O 
sole O 
purpose O 
of O 
the O 
interposer O 
was O 
to O 
raise O 
a O 
signal O 
on O 
the O 
CPU O 
to O 
force O 
its O 
cache O 
to O 
operate O 
in O 
the O 
write-thru O 
mode O 
which O 
was O 
compatible O 
with O 
most O 
ZIF O 
Socket O 
3 O 
486 O 
motherboards. O 
Needless O 
to O 
say, O 
this O 
was O 
the O 
least O 
successful O 
"OverDrive" O 
CPU O 
ever O 
done O 
by O 
Intel. ORG
The O 
486-DX4 O 
OverDrive O 
was O 
OK, O 
as O 
were O 
several O 
Socket O 
5 O 
Pentium O 
OverDrives O 
and O 
the O 
Socket O 
8 O 
Pentium O 
Pro O 
OverDrive. O 
Finally O 
Intel ORG
gave O 
up O 
on O 
OverDrives... O

McGill O 
says O 
the O 
Law O 
says O 
so. O 
In O 
Q O 
he's O 
in O 
charge O 
of O 
the O 
car O 
from O 
the O 
moment O 
he O 
attempts O 
to O 
put O 
the O 
key O 
in O 
the O 
door O 
lock. O 
If O 
he's O 
asleep O 
in O 
the O 
back O 
seat O 
with O 
the O 
keys O 
in O 
his O 
possession O 
then O 
he's O 
the O 
person O 
in O 
charge O 
of O 
the O 
car. O 
The O 
offence O 
is O 
being O 
drunk O 
in O 
charge O 
of O 
a O 
vehicle O 
-- O 
as O 
distinct O 
from O 
being O 
drunk O 
while O 
operating O 
a O 
vehicle O 
(which O 
is O 
a O 
separate O 
offence). O 
The O 
way O 
to O 
avoid O 
being O 
charged O 
is O 
to O 
give O 
the O 
keys O 
to O 
someone O 
else O 
to O 
unlock O 
the O 
door O 
and O 
have O 
them O 
hang O 
on O 
to O 
the O 
keys O 
until O 
you're O 
below O 
.05. O 
The O 
standard O 
ruse O 
is O 
to O 
throw O 
the O 
keys O 
under O 
the O 
car O 
after O 
you've O 
unlocked O 
the O 
door O 
(which O 
you O 
can O 
later O 
claim O 
was O 
unlocked O 
by O 
a O 
person O 
unknown). O 
In O 
this O 
case O 
the O 
offender O 
escaped O 
conviction O 
first O 
time O 
around O 
because O 
it O 
was O 
accepted O 
that O 
he O 
attempted O 
to O 
get O 
rid O 
of O 
the O 
keys, O 
which O 
supposedly O

can O

charged? O 
Sure, O 
no O

do O 
that, O

just O 
strictly O

does O 
the O

what O

McGill O 
says O 
the O 
Law O

If O

in O 
his O 
pocket, O 
or O 
a O 
case O 
of O 
gelignite O

I'd O

that O 
half O 
the O 
people O 
on O 
this O 
ng O 
would O 
be O 
baying O

Where's O 
the O

Same O

if O 
the O 
pistol O 
is O 
in O

So O 
long O

you O 
don't O 
attempt O 
to O 
access O 
either O 
any O

isn't O

I'm O

when O 
I O 
lived O 
in O 
another O

the O 
local O

the O 
town O

in O 
his O 
driveway O 
after O 
following O 
him O 
home O

The O 
drunk O 
was O 
acquitted O 
on O 
the O 
technicality O 
that O 
he O 
wasn't O 
on O 
a O 
public O 
road O 
when O 
the O 
cop O 
arrested O 
him. O 
Wouldn't O 
have O 
happened O 
under O 
Qld O 
law O 
-- O 
and O 
shouldn't O 
have O 
happened O 
anywhere O 
else. O 
So O 
whose O 
law O 
is O 
stupid? O 
Agreed, O 
and O 
not O 
likely O 
to O 
happen O 
in O 
Q. O 
You're O

I O 
am O 
not O 
pursuing O 
it O

I O 
was O

go O 
inside O 
the O 
pain O 
to O 
the O 
good O 
place O 
without O 
training, O

I O

much O

If O 
you O 
go O 
for O 
a O 
home O 
birth O 
you O 
can O 
rent O 
a O 
birthing O 
pool. O 
I O 
wouldn't O 
necessaritly O 
say O 
that O 
you O 
will O 
have O 
a O 
repeat O 
labour! O 
My O 
first O 
labour O 
I O 
was O 
30 O 
hours O 
and O 
had O 
an O 
epidural O 
after O 
22 O 
hours. O 
#2 O 
I O 
went O 
in O 
saying O 
"give O 
me O 
the O 
epidural O 
asap-and O 
never O 
got O 
to O 
the O 
state O 
where O 
I O 
felt O 
that O 
I O 
needed O 
it. O 
Only O 
had O 
tens O 
and O 
gas-and-air. O 
So O 
don't O 
give O 
up O 
on O 
the O 
idea O 
of O 
a O 
natural O 
birth O 
because O 
last O 
time O 
was O 
painful. O 
I O 
think O 
different O 
people/different O 
labours O 
are O 
different, O 
so O 
just O 
because O 
one O 
person O 
says O 
"I O 
did O 
*** O 
and O 
it O 
didn't O 
hurt O 
a O 
bit" O 
doesn't O 
mean O 
that O 
it O 
will O 
work O 
for O 
someone O 
else, O 
so O 
going O 
in O 
with O 
a O 
set O 
of O 
suggestions, O 
and O 
being O 
prepared O 
to O 
try O 
them O 
and O 
see O 
which O 
is O 
the O 
best O 
is O 
probably O 
the O 
most O 
helpful. O 
(Oh O

The O

that O

whatever O 
the O 
original O 
charges O 
were O 
in O 
both O 
cases. O 
That O 
means O 
she O 
has O 
given O 
up O 
the O 
right O 
to O 
force O 
the O 
FL O 
authorities O 
to O 
go O 
thru O 
legal O 
due O 
process O 
in O 
demanding O 
that O 
the O 
AZ O 
authorities O 
turn O 
her O 
over O 
to O 
them O 
for O 
further O 
prosecution. O 
All O 
the O 
FL O 
prosecutors O 
have O 
to O 
do O 
is O 
ask, O 
and O 
the O 
AZ O 
jailers O 
will O 
pack O 
her O 
up O 
in O 
a O 
van O 
or O 
a O 
plane O 
and O 
ship O 
her O 
back O 
to O 
FL O 
for O 
trial O 
on O 
the O 
FTA O 
charge O 
and O 
probably O 
to O 
commence O 
her O 
serving O 
time O 
under O 
the O 
suspended O 
sentence O 
that O 
went O 
along O 
with O 
her O 
original O 
probation. O 
She's O 
in O 
DEEP O 
SH__T O 
if O 
you O 
haven't O 
already O 
figure O 
that O 
out. O 
Nowhere O 
in O 
USA O 
would O 
be O 
far O 
enough O 
if O 
she O 
waived O 
extradition. O 
Of O 
course O 
they O 
do. O 
That's O 
what O 
her O 
waiver O 
of O 
extradition O 
meant O 
they O 
could O 
do. O 
They O 
let O 
her O 
serve O 
her O 
time O 
in O 
AZ, O 
then O 
they O 
come O 
and O 
get O 
her O 
to O 
serve O 
her O 
time O 
in O 
FL. O 
This O 
is O 
what O 
happens O 
when O 
people O 
blow O 
off O 
the O 
chances O 
they O 
are O 
given O 
to O 
straighten O 
out O 
by O 
being O 
given O 
probation. O 
Thumb O 
your O 
nose O 
at O 
the O 
court O 
often O 
enough, O 
and O 
they O 
will O 
bring O 
all O 
sorts O 
of O 
crap O 
down O 
on O 
your O 
head, O 
re-instituting O 
the O 
original O 
suspended O 
sentences O 
and O 
possibly O 
adding O 
on O 
for O 
the O 
FTA. O 
What O 
is O 
it O 
GOOD O 
for? O 
It's O 
good O 
for O 
the O 
STATE, O 
not O 
for O 
the O 
convict. O 
It O 
lets O 
them O 
skip O 
some O 
of O 
the O 
legal O 
procedures O 
she O 
would O 
otherwise O 
be O 
entitled O 
to, O 
in O 
order O 
to O 
ship O 
her O 
from O 
one O 
state O 
to O 
another. O 
But O 
they O 
were O 
entitled O 
to O 
demand O 
that O 
waiver O 
as O 
a O 
condition O 
of O 
probation; O 
if O 
she O 
had O 
not O 
agreed O 
to O 
voluntarily O 
waive O 
that O 
right, O 
they O 
probably O 
would O 
have O 
just O 
thrown O 
her O 
in O 
jail O 
for O 
the O 
3 O 
year O 
sentence O 
the O 
first O 
time O 
around O 
and O 
she O 
wouldn't O 
have O 
been O 
given O 
the O 
chance O 
to O 
go O 
straight O 
during O 
probation O 
and O 
avoid O 
jail O 
altogether. O 
She O 
doesn't O 
have O 
a O 
lot O 
of O 
leeway O 
here. O 
She O 
has O 
done O 
this O 
numerous O 
times O 
and O 
they O 
are O 
not O 
likely O 
to O 
give O 
her O 
another O 
wide O 
open O 
chance O 
like O 
they O 
did O 
the O 
first O 
3 O 
times. O 
She O 
will O 
probably O 
have O 
to O 
serve O 
out O 
her O 
sentence O 
in O 
FL, O 
AND O 
if O 
she O 
has O 
not O 
already O 
served O 
all O 
her O 
time O 
in O 
AZ, O 
they O 
will O 
then O 
ship O 
her O 
back O 
there O 
to O 
do O 
THAT O 
time. O 
Waitaminit, O 
you O 
said O 
she O 
DOES O 
have O 
a O 
public O 
defender? O 
OK, O 
he/she O 
is O 
doing O 
all O 
they O 
can, O 
but O 
that's O 
not O 
much, O 
under O 
the O 
circumstances. O 
You're O 
complaining O 
that O 
YOU O 
can't O 
get O 
an O 
atty? O 
You O 
don't O 
need O 
one. O 
And O 
her O 
attys O 
will O 
not O 
talk O 
to O 
you O 
because O 
you O 
are O 
not O 
entitled O 
to O 
participate O 
in O 
their O 
confidential O 
communications O 
with O 
their O 
client. O 
But O 
won't O 
your O 
GF O 
tell O 
you O 
these O 
things? O 
If O 
not, O 
maybe O 
it's O 
because O 
she O 
doesn't O 
want O 
you O 
to O 
know O 
either. O 
Which O 
you O 
would O 
then O 
take O 
into O 
account O 
in O 
deciding O 
if O 
you O 
still O 
want O 
her O 
to O 
be O 
your O 
significant O 
other. O 
Anyway, O 
good O 
luck, O

Question O 
regarding O 
simple O 
assault O 
&amp; O 
battery O 
My O 
roommate O 
was O 
hospitalized O 
in O 
mid-November O 
for O 
lung O 
surgery O 
and O 
spent O 
several O 
days O 
on O 
loads O 
of O 
pain O 
medication. O 
On O 
the O 
fourth O 
day O 
of O 
his O 
stay, O 
he O 
was O 
moved O 
out O 
of O 
the O 
ICU O 
to O 
the O 
step-down O 
unit, O 
with O 
a O 
diagnosis O 
of O 
"ICU O 
Psychosis O 
secondary O 
to O 
narcotic O 
administration" O 
and O 
post O 
thoracostomy." O 
He O 
was O 
confused, O 
because O 
of O 
the O 
medication O 
but O 
was O 
not O 
aggressive O 
or O 
threatening O 
in O 
any O 
manner. O 
I O 
saw O 
him O 
each O 
day O 
and O 
as O 
soon O 
as O 
we O 
spoke, O 
he O 
became O 
oriented O 
and O 
was O 
perfectly O 
fine. O 
This O 
was O 
witnessed O 
by O 
both O 
the O 
nursing O 
staff O 
and O 
his O 
doctors. O 
During O 
the O 
early O 
evening O 
hours O 
of O 
his O 
sixth O 
hospital O 
day, O 
he O 
got O 
up, O 
dressed, O 
pulled O 
his O 
chest O 
tube O 
out O 
and O 
managed O 
to O 
get O 
out O 
of O 
the O 
hospital O 
and O 
across O 
four O 
lanes O 
of O 
busy O 
evening O 
traffic, O 
to O 
our O 
apartment. O 
By O 
the O 
time O 
he O 
got O 
to O 
our O 
home, O 
he O 
was O 
very O 
short O 
of O 
breath O 
and O 
there O 
was O 
a O 
nurse O 
and O 
orderly O 
who O 
told O 
me O 
"he's O 
crazy O 
and O 
just O 
walked O 
out." O 
I O 
sat O 
him O 
down O 
on O 
the O 
couch O 
and O 
talked O 
to O 
him, O 
and O 
asked O 
him O 
what O 
had O 
happened. O 
He O 
said O 
he'd O 
asked O 
for O 
something O 
for O 
pain O 
and O 
they O 
told O 
hime O 
he O 
couldn't O 
have O 
anything. O 
Then O 
the O 
orderly O 
was O 
apparently O 
rude O 
to O 
him, O 
and O 
that's O 
when O 
he O 
got O 
up O 
and O 
decided O 
to O 
come O 
home. O 
A O 
short O 
time O 
later, O 
two O 
police O 
officers O 
showed O 
up O 
and O 
told O 
me O 
they O 
had O 
to O 
take O 
him O 
back O 
to O 
the O 
hospital. O 
He O 
went O 
back O 
with O 
the O 
officers, O 
gave O 
them O 
no O 
problems O 
at O 
all. O 
I O 
received O 
a O 
call O 
from O 
the O 
shift O 
supervisor O 
who O 
told O 
me O 
they'd O 
replaced O 
his O 
chest O 
tube, O 
given O 
him O 
some O 
pain O 
medication O 
and O 
he O 
was O 
doing O 
much O 
better. O 
I O 
told O 
her O 
to O 
pass O 
on O 
the O 
other O 
shifts O 
that O 
if O 
he O 
became O 
confused O 
or O 
upset O 
to O 
call O 
me, O 
and O 
I'd O 
talk O 
to O 
him, O 
and O 
get O 
him O 
settled O 
down. O 
At O 
2:15 O 
the O 
next O 
morning, O 
I O 
received O 
a O 
call O 
from O 
the O 
night O 
shift O 
supervisor O 
who O 
told O 
me O 
my O 
friend O 
had O 
been O 
"verbally O 
abusive O 
and O 
aggressive" O 
and O 
would O 
I O 
come O 
over O 
and O 
talk O 
to O 
him. O 
So, O 
I O 
went O 
over O 
there, O 
getting O 
to O 
his O 
room O 
right O 
at O 
2:30. O 
There O 
were O 
two O 
cops O 
there O 
and O 
I O 
asked O 
what O 
had O 
happened. O 
My O 
roommate O 
was O 
in O 
bed, O 
sound O 
asleep, O 
and O 
had O 
all O 
of O 
his O 
clothes O 
on. O 
A O 
nurse O 
said, O 
"He O 
beat O 
two O 
of O 
us O 
up. O 
The O 
cops O 
are O 
here O 
because O 
we're O 
pressing O 
charges." O 
I've O 
lived O 
with O 
this O 
man O 
9 O 
years O 
and O 
never O 
in O 
that O 
time O 
have O 
I O 
ever O 
seen O 
him O 
be O 
aggressive, O 
violent O 
or O 
abusive O 
in O 
anyway. O 
I O 
asked O 
to O 
speak O 
to O 
the O 
two O 
nurses O 
whom O 
he'd O 
alledgedly O 
hit O 
and O 
was O 
told O 
I O 
couldn't O 
do O 
that. O 
An O 
hour O 
or O 
so O 
passed O 
and O 
the O 
got O 
my O 
roommate O 
out O 
of O 
bed, O 
took O 
his O 
chest O 
tube O 
out O 
and O 
discharged O 
him. O 
He O 
was O 
sent O 
to O 
another O 
hospital O 
with O 
a O 
psych O 
unit O 
until O 
his O 
psychosis O 
resolved. O 
I O 
was O 
given O 
copies O 
of O 
a O 
citation O 
for O 
simple O 
assault O 
and O 
battery, O 
then O 
went O 
to O 
the O 
police O 
station O 
several O 
days O 
later O 
to O 
find O 
out O 
what O 
other O 
paperwork O 
was O 
available O 
on O 
this O 
incident. O 
I O 
was O 
given O 
a O 
copy O 
of O 
a O 
different O 
citation, O 
but O 
with O 
the O 
identical O 
information O 
from O 
the O 
one O 
I'd O 
gotten O 
the O 
night O 
of O 
the O 
incident. O 
The O 
police O 
report O 
has O 
the O 
victim O 
saying O 
she O 
was O 
"choked O 
to O 
where O 
she O 
almost O 
lost O 
consciousness, O 
struck O 
in O 
the O 
face O 
with O 
a O 
belt O 
buckle O 
and O 
it O 
had O 
left O 
large O 
marks, O 
and O 
that O 
he'd O 
grabbed O 
her O 
breasts O 
and O 
left O 
marks. O 
According O 
to O 
the O 
police O 
report, O 
this O 
woman O 
never O 
reported O 
to O 
the O 
ER O 
for O 
verification O 
of O 
the O 
injuries O 
and O 
no O 
one O 
else O 
can O 
verify O 
exactly O 
what O 
happened O 
to O 
provoke O 
this O 
incident. O 
My O 
roommate O 
has O 
no O 
recollection O 
of O 
the O 
time O 
from O 
the O 
day O 
before O 
the O 
incident O 
happened O 
until O 
he O 
woke O 
up O 
at O 
the O 
other O 
hospital. O 
He O 
was O 
cited O 
for O 
simple O 
assault O 
and O 
battery. O 
If O 
there O 
is O 
no O 
evidence, O 
and O 
that O 
includes O 
the O 
belt O 
buckle, O 
how O 
can O 
the O 
county O 
prosecute O 
this O 
case.? O 
All O 
of O 
his O 
belongings O 
were O 
returned O 
to O 
me O 
upon O 
his O 
discharge, O 
with O 
the O 
exception O 
of O 
the O 
belt O 
buckle. O 
The O 
police O 
do O 
not O 
have O 
it O 
and O 
the O 
hospital O 
doesn't O 
know O 
what O 
happened O 
to O 
it. O 
Also, O 
I O 
was O 
looking O 
at O 
both O 
citations, O 
I O 
didn't O 
get O 
to O 
the O 
hospital O 
until O 
2:30 O 
am, O 
and O 
the O 
officer O 
has O 
the O 
time O 
of O 
incident O 
as O 
being O 
at O 
2:34 O 
am. O 
Does O 
anyone O 
besides O 
me O 
see O 
a O 
problem O 
with O 
any O 
of O 
this? O 
What O 
kind O 
of O 
recourse O 
does O 
my O 
roommate O 
have O 
in O 
all O 
of O 
this? O

You O

are O

In O 
addition, O 
I's O 
suggest O 
raising O 
the O 
stakes. O 
The O 
hospital O 
obviously O 
knew O 
that O 
your O 
friend O 
was O 
having O 
head O 
problems, O 
and O 
they O 
improperly O 
treated O 
him O 
by O 
not O 
sending O 
him O 
to O 
a O 
psych O 
ward, O 
which O 
allowed O 
the O 
situation O 
to O 
get O 
worse O 
until O 
the O 
point O 
where O 
he O 
assaulted O 
someone. O 
Sue O 
them O 
for O 
malpractice, O 
and O 
make O 
the O 
number O 
big O 
enough O 
to O 
get O 
some O 
serious O 
attention. O

Since O

Yes, O

you O

not O 
yet O

you O 
gave O

the O

in O 
February O 
2004 O 
but O 
that O 
the O 
discharge O 
didn't O 
come O 
until O 
June O 
of O 
2004. O 
That O 
means O 
that O 
he O 
received O 
the O 
shares O 
while O 
he O 
was O 
still O 
in O 
bankruptcy, O 
which O 
means O 
that O 
the O 
shares O 
were O 
potentially O 
assets O 
that O 
the O 
trustee O 
could O 
use O 
to O 
pay O 
off O

A O 
bankruptcy O 
case O 
doesn't O 
close O 
until O 
you O 
get O 
the O 
discharge O 
order, O 
and O 
until O 
then O 
everything O 
that O 
the O 
debtor O 
receives O 
is O 
fair O 
game O 
for O 
the O 
trustee. O 
If O 
the O 
trustee O 
was O 
informed O 
of O 
the O

and O 
did O 
nothing O 
about O 
it, O 
you O

more O

if O

the O 
fact O 
directly, O 
then O 
you O 
may O 
be O 
in O 
trouble. O 
If, O 
however, O 
your O

the O 
shares O 
after O 
he O 
obtained O 
an O 
order O

You O 
do O 
well O 
to O 
wonder O 
why O 
the O 
BTK O 
killer O 
was O 
not O 
captured O 
until O 
yesterday. O 
The O 
informal O 
speculation O 
is O 
that O 
the O 
Wichita O 
police O 
department O 
was O 
not O 
up O 
to O 
the O 
task. O 
Consider O 
this: O 
-One O 
of O 
the O 
BTK O 
killer's O 
victims O 
lived O 
on O 
the O 
same O 
street O 
as O 
the O 
killer O 
-The O 
BTK O 
killer O 
once O 
called O 
up O 
a O 
police O 
dispatcher O 
and O 
told O 
her O 
of O 
the O 
crime O 
he O 
just O 
committed, O 
and O 
still O 
they O 
could O 
not O 
catch O 
him O 
-the O 
BTK O 
killer O 
was O 
a O 
known O 
nitpicker O 
and O 
nuissance. O 
This O 
is O 
actually O 
a O 
indicator O 
in O 
profiles O 
of O 
serial O 
killers O 
and O 
mastermind O 
terrorists. O 
-the O 
BTK O 
killer O 
was O 
only O 
found O 
out O 
when O 
his O 
daughter O 
recognized O 
certain O 
traits O 
and O 
turned O 
in O 
her O 
DNA, O 
which O 
was O 
a O 
close O 
match O 
to O 
the O 
DNA O 
on O 
file O 
for O 
her O 
father. O 
Like O 
in O 
the O 
case O 
of O 
the O 
Unibomber, PER
if O 
it O 
wasn't O 
for O 
the O 
foresight O 
and O 
charity O 
of O 
a O 
relative, O 
the O 
BTK O 
killer O 
would O 
still O 
be O 
loose. O 
I O 
was O 
once O 
reading O 
how O 
a O 
criminal O 
was O 
being O 
tracked O 
in O 
Washington, O 
DC, O 
and O 
how O 
he O 
escaped O 
a O 
police O 
dragnet O 
several O 
times, O 
once O 
by O 
taking O 
a O 
taxi. O 
Though O 
there O 
are O 
very O 
brave O 
police, O 
to O 
a O 
large O 
extent O 
the O 
police O 
have O 
no O 
incentive O 
to O 
capture O 
a O 
criminal, O 
just O 
to O 
stay O 
out O 
of O 
harm's O 
way O 
and O 
to O 
collect O 
facts O

the O

Re: O 
[TAN] O 
Parole O 
Getting O 
out O 
on O 
parole O 
is O 
usually O 
a O 
reward O 
for O 
good O 
behavior O 
while O 
serving O 
time. O 
So O 
you're O 
basically O 
free, O 
with O 
the O 
expectation O 
that O 
you O 
will O 
not O 
leave O 
the O 
state O 
(assuming O 
you've O 
been O 
jailed O 
by O 
the O 
state O 
gov't) O 
and O 
you O 
have O 
to O 
check O 
in O 
with O 
your O 
parole O 
officer O 
on O 
a O 
regular O 
basis O 
(I O 
think O 
they O 
give O 
you O 
a O 
schedule). O 
I O 
*believe* O 
you O 
are O 
also O 
expected O 
to O 
get O 
a O 
job, O 
housing, O 
etc. O 
and O 
report O 
this O 
also. O 
In O 
some O 
cases O 
you O 
may O 
be O 
referred O 
to O 
a O 
specific O 
'halfway' O 
house O 
for O 
reintroduction O 
into O 
society, O 
and O 
provided O 
with O 
a O 
simple O 
job. O 
As O 
for O 
how O 
long O 
it O 
lasts, O 
I O 
would O 
say O 
that O 
it O 
lasts O 
for O 
the O 
rest O 
of O 
your O 
sentence, O 
but O 
I'm O 
not O 
sure O 
about O 
that. O 
Also, O 
you O 
can O 
call O 
someone O 
to O 
come O 
pick O 
you O 
up O 
when O 
you O 
leave, O 
or O 
call O 
a O 
taxi O 
I O 
guess. O 
Not O 
just O 
state-specific, O 
judge(jury)-specific O 
and O 
case-specific. O 
For O 
some O 
reason, O 
I O 
can't O 
recall O 
if O 
selling O 
drugs O 
to O 
minors O 
qualifies O 
as O 
a O 
jury O

or O 
what. O 
But O 
these O

In O

an O

in O

one O 
of O 
the O 
three O 
major O 
forces O

A O 
few O 
people O 
will O 
turn O

elect O 
somebody. O 
It O 
is O 
hailed O 
as O 
the O 
greatest O 
triumph O 
of O 
democracy O 
since O 
the O 
defeat O 
of O 
Imperial O 
Japan. O 
In O 
Washington O 
State, O 
our O 
governor's O 
race O 
may O 
be O 
undecided O 
for O 
months O 
to O 
come. O 
Following O 
the O 
election O 
and O 
recount O 
process O 
exactly O 
as O 
outlined O 
in O 
our O 
state O 
constitution, O 
the O 
democratic ORG
candidate O 
won O 
by O 
a O 
margin O 
of O 
less O 
than O 
200 O 
votes. O 
With O 
roughly O 
three O 
million O 
votes O 
cast O 
in O 
the O 
race, O 
the O 
margin O 
of O 
victory O 
was O 
a O 
few O 
ten O 
thousands O

or O 
some O 
such O

For O 
all O

it O 
was O 
a O

but O 
somebody O 
had O 
to O

a O

more O

this O

0.0000001 O

In O 
Washington O

the O

also O

1999-2000. O 
It O 
took O 
six O 
weeks O 
before O 
the O 
USCF ORG
paid O 
the O 
guaranteed O 
prizes O 
the O 
prize O 
winners O 
had O 
won O 
at O 
the O 
US O 
Open. O 
I O 
have O 
just O 
found O 
out O 
something O 
that O 
insiders O 
had O 
known O 
for O 
a O 
long O 
time. O 
The O 
USCF ORG
did O 
not O 
have O 
zero O 
money O 
in O 
the O 
bank. O 
It O 
had O 
$85,000 O 
in O 
another O 
bank O 
account O 
that O 
nobody O 
knew O 
about. O 
This O 
was O 
not O 
due O 
to O 
any O 
malfeasance. O 
The O 
office O 
accountant O 
for O 
the O 
USCF ORG
had O 
set O 
up O 
a O 
separate O 
bank O 
account O 
and O 
had O 
put O 
the O 
entry O 
fees O 
from O 
the O 
US O 
Open O 
into O 
that O 
account. O 
Nobody O 
knew O 
about O 
that O 
separate O 
bank O 
account, O 
except O 
for O 
the O 
accountant O 
herself. O 
When O 
this O 
was O 
discovered, O 
the O 
accountant O 
explained O 
that O 
she O 
was O 
planning O 
to O 
keep O 
the O 
money O 
in O 
that O 
account O 
until O 
the O 
tournament O 
was O 
closed O 
out. O 
Perhaps O 
the O 
accountant O 
was O 
following O 
a O 
procedure O 
followed O 
by O 
the O 
USCF ORG
for O 
scholastic O 
tournaments. O 
At O 
scholastic O 
tournaments, O 
no O 
cash O 
prizes O 
are O 
paid. O 
However, O 
in O 
adult O 
tournaments, O 
the O 
players O 
expect O 
to O 
receive O 
their O 
prizes, O 
and O 
to O 
receive O 
them O 
immediately. O 
For O 
this O 
act O 
of O 
stupidity O 
which O 
had O 
caused O 
a O 
grave O 
crisis O 
in O 
the O 
USCF, ORG
the O 
accountant O 
was O 
immediately O 
fired. O 
Had O 
the O 
existence O 
of O 
this O 
$85,000 O 
in O 
a O 
secret O 
bank O 
account O 
been O 
known, O 
it O 
would O 
not O 
have O 
been O 
necessary O 
to O 
fire O 
those O 
17 O 
people O 
right O 
away. O 
Perhaps O 
in O 
the O 
long O 
run O 
it O 
was O 
a O 
good O 
thing O 
to O 
fire O 
them, O 
but O 
it O 
might O 
not O 
have O 
been O 
a O 
good O 
idea O 
to O 
fire O 
them O 
all O 
abruptly, O

the O

about. O 
I O 
knew O 
that O 
they O 
would O 
get O 
corrected O 
as O 
a O 
matter O 
of O 
course O 
during O 
fiscal O

resulting O 
in O 
understatement O 
of O 
2003 O 
income O 
and O 
overstatement O 
of O 
2004. O 
And, O 
of O 
course, O 
that O 
is O 
what O 
happened. O 
I O 
just O 
had O 
no O 
idea O 
that O 
the O 
new O

would O 
see O 
it O 
as O 
leverage O 
to O 
seize O 
power O 
and O 
pummel O 
the O 
office O 
staff. O 
Not O 
only O 
was O 
there O 
adequate O 
cash O 
put O 
aside, O 
we O 
had O 
approval O 
for O 
an O 
equity O 
loan O 
on O 
the O 
building O 
to O 
bridge O 
the O 
move. O 
But O 
I O 
didn't O 
want O 
to O 
pay O 
the O 
$10,000 O 
points O 
and O 
interest O 
unless O 
and O 
until O 
it O 
was O 
absolutely O 
necessary. O 
We O 
also O 
had O 
a O 
buyer O 
for O 
the O 
building O 
at O 
a O 
prize O 
much O 
higher O 
than O 
it O 
was O 
eventually O 
sold O 
for O 
and O 
a O 
commitment O 
for O 
4% O 
bank O 
financing O 
in O 
Crossville. O 
Staff O 
reductions O 
were O 
clearly O 
in O 
the O 
works O 
pending O 
system O 
changes O 
that O 
would O 
be O 
facilitated O 
by O 
any O 
move, O 
Miami, O

or O 
elsewhere. O 
To O 
make O 
the O 
staff O

without O

was O 
absurd O

this O

the O

are O

using O 
their O

for O 
just O 
that, O

when O

you O

everything O 
he O

to O 
try O

oil O

a O 
much O 
bigger O

your O

this O

a O

because O 
you're O 
not O 
really O 
proving O 
anything, O 
you're O 
just O 
making O 
accusations O 
without O 
proof. O 
ok, O 
they O 
made O 
a O 
very O 
very O 
small O

a O 
material O 
that O 
could O

be O 
used O

a O

if O 
they O 
had O 
more O 
of O 
it O 
possibly. O

the O 
fact O 
is O 
that O 
iran O 
is O 
cooperating O 
with O 
most O 
of O 
the O 
international O 
community O 
on O 
this O 
issue, O 
whether O 
your O 
believe O 
them O 
or O 
not. O 
this O 
was O 
about O 
nuclear O

that O

be O 
wondering O 
why O 
there O 
were O 
two O 
carousel O 
organizations O 
in O 
the O 
first O 
place. O 
The O 
National ORG
Carousel ORG

was O 
founded O 
in O 
the O 
early O 
1970's O 
by O 
a O 
group O 
of O 
art O 
historians O 
and O 
collectors, O 
including O 
Frederick PER
Fried, PER
author O 
of O 
the O 
1964 O 
book O 
"A O 
Pictorial O 
History O 
of O 
The O 
Carousel" O 
that O 
single-handedly O 
gave O 
the O 
classic O 
hand-carved O 
wooden O 
carousel O 
the O 
respect O 
and O 
appreciation O 
it O 
deserved. O 
Other O 
founders O 
included O 
Charlotte PER
Dinger, PER
who O 
was O 
already O 
a O 
major O 
collector O 
of O 
carousel O 
artwork O 
at O 
the O 
time. O 
The O 
purpose O 
of O 
the O 
NCA ORG
is O 
"to O 
promote O 
conservation, O 
appreciation, O 
knowledge O 
and O 
enjoyment O 
of O 
the O 
art O 
of O 
the O 
classic O 
wooden O 
carousel O 
and O 
especially O 
the O 
preservation O 
of O 
complete O 
wooden O 
carousels." O 
The O 
organization O 
attracted O 
a O 
wide O 
range O 
of O 
members, O 
including O 
carousel O 
enthusiasts, O 
owners/operators, O 
theme O 
and O 
amusement O 
parks, O 
museums, O 
libraries, O 
those O 
in O 
the O 
entertainment/recreation O 
industry, O 
art O 
collectors O 
and O 
even O 
auction O 
houses, O 
among O 
others. O 
It O 
was O 
the O 
presence O 
of O 
these O 
last O 
two O 
named O 
groups O 
that O 
would O 
eventually O 
stir O 
up O 
controversy. O 
Thanks O 
in O 
large O 
part O 
to O 
the O 
NCA, ORG
the O 
art O 
of O 
the O 
carousel O 
was O 
receiving O 
a O 
lot O 
of O 
public O 
attention O 
and O 
appreciation O 
that O 
it O 
had O 
not O 
enjoyed O 
before. O 
However, O 
this O 
new O 
and O 
brighter O 
spotlight O 
on O 
these O 
antique O 
rides O 
also O 
had O 
the O 
unfortunate O 
effect O 
of O 
enhancing O 
the O 
collectibility O 
and O 
monetary O 
value O 
of O 
operational O 
carousels. O 
They O 
had O 
become O 
worth O 
more O 
money O 
dead O 
(i.e. O 
in O 
pieces) O 
than O 
alive O 
(i.e. O 
functioning). O 
As O 
such, O 
during O 
the O 
1980's O 
many O 
beautiful O 
and O 
unique O 
wooden O 
carousels O 
would O 
be O 
broken O 
up O 
at O 
the O 
auction O 
block, O 
as O 
owners O 
rushed O 
to O 
cash O 
in O 
on O 
the O 
antique O 
marketplace. O 
The O 
liability O 
insurance O 
crisis O 
further O 
aggravated O 
the O 
situation, O 
as O 
amusement O 
park O 
operators O 
sought O 
to O 
cut O 
their O 
losses, O 
while O 
at O 
the O 
same O 
time O 
liquidate O 
underperforming O 
carousels O 
to O 
raise O 
capital O 
for O 
the O 
purchase O 
of O 
newer O 
and O 
more O 
profitable O 
(thrill) O 
rides. O 
Some O 
collectors O 
of O 
carousel O 
art O 
and O 
auction O 
houses O 
were O 
accused O 
of O 
using O 
their O 
NCA ORG
affiliation O 
to O 
gain O 
information O 
about O 
vintage O 
carousels O 
that O 
they O 
could O 
target O 
for O 
breakup O 
to O 
their O 
own O 
personal O 
profit, O 
a O 
practice O 
certainly O 
contrary O 
to O 
the O 
stated O 
goals O 
of O 
the O 
organization. O 
The O 
increasing O 
rift O 
between O 
the O 
"preservationists" O 
and O 
"collectors" O 
would O 
eventually O 
boil O 
over O 
into O 
an O 
internal O 
political O 
struggle O 
that O 
caused O 
many O 
in O 
the O

faction O 
of O 
the O 
NCA ORG
to O 
walk O 
out O 
of O 
the O 
group, O

founders O 
such O 
as O 
Charlotte PER

The O 
preservationists O 
would O 
chose O 
to O 
remain O 
with O 
the O 
NCA, ORG
including O 
Fred PER

At O 
this O 
time O 
in O 
the O 
late O 
1970's, O 
carousel O 
artwork O 
collector O

printer O 
Marge PER
Swenson PER
was O 
the O 
editor O 
of O 
the O 
NCA's ORG
Merry-Go-Roundup O 
publication. O 
The O 
political O 
struggle O 
that O 
occurred O 
within O 
the O 
NCA ORG
resulted O 
in O 
two O 
slates O 
of O 
officers O 
being O 
presented O 
for O 
approval O 
to O 
the O 
membership, O 
something O 
that O 
was O 
not O 
supposed O 
to O 
happen. O 
A O 
thicker-than-usual O 
issue O 
of O 
the O 
Roundup O 
would O 
be O 
filled O 
with O 
accusations O 
from O 
both O 
factions O 
in O 
the O 
group O 
each O 
accusing O 
the O 
other O 
of O 
improper O 
behavior. O 
Swenson PER
herself O 
would O 
also O 
leave O 
the O 
NCA. ORG
Not O 
much O 
later, O 
she O 
began O 
publishing O 
her O 
own O 
magazine O 
called O 
"Carousel O 
Art", O 
which O 
was O 
essentially O 
a O 
scholarly O 
photo O 
album O 
depicting O 
different O 
carvers O 
and O 
styles O 
each O 
month. O 
Meanwhile, O 
those O 
collectors O 
who O 
left O 
the O 
National ORG
Carousel ORG
Association ORG
banded O 
together O 
to O 
form O 
the O 
American ORG
Carousel ORG
Society ORG
(ACS), ORG
whose O 
stated O 
aims O 
of O 
carousel O 
preservation O 
also O 
recognized O 
collectors O 
as O 
a O 
positive O 
asset O 
towards O 
that O 
goal. O 
For O 
the O 
next O 
couple O 
of O 
decades, O 
the O 
two O 
carousel O 
organizations O 
would O 
co-exist, O 
each O 
attracting O 
its O 
share O 
of O 
members. O 
Some O 
would O 
actually O 
join O 
both O 
groups, O 
and O 
even O 
attend O 
both O 
of O 
their O 
annual O 
conventions. O 
During O 
the O 
mid-1980's O 
Walter PER
Louck PER
would O 
begin O 
publishing O 
"The O 
Carousel O 
Trader", O 
later O 
renamed O 
"The O 
Carousel O 
News O 
&amp; O 
Trader". O 
This O 
monthly O 
magazine O 
would O 
cover O 
all O 
angles O 
and O 
sides O 
of O 
the O 
story O 
of O 
the O 
carousel O 
and O 
be O 
well O 
received O 
by O 
all O 
carousel O 
enthusiasts. O 
About O 
a O 
decade O 
later, O 
Carousel O 
Art O 
would O 
suddenly O 
cease O 
publication. O 
The O 
NCA ORG
would O 
continue O 
to O 
issue O 
the O 
Roundup O 
to O 
its O 
members. O 
The O 
mid O 
to O 
late O 
1990's O 
saw O 
the O 
passing O 
of O 
NCA ORG
founder O 
Fred PER
Fried, PER
and O 
also O 
that O 
of O 
Charlotte PER
Dinger, PER
both O 
who O 
represented O 
the O 
two O 
opposite O 
points O 
of O 
view O 
in O 
the O 
carousel O 
preservation O 
debate. O 
Coincidentally O 
and O 
amazingly, O 
the O 
art O 
of O 
building O 
hand-carved O 
carousels O 
(and O 
even O 
bandorgans) O 
has O 
been O 
revived, O 
with O 
firms O 
such O 
as O 
Carousel ORG
Works ORG
and O 
Carousel ORG
Magic ORG
again O 
building O 
the O 
popular O 
rides O 
in O 
classic O 
design. O 
This O 
development O 
seems O 
to O 
have O 
greatly O 
alleviated O 
the O 
antique O 
marketplace O 
pressures O 
that O 
have O 
doomed O 
so O 
many O 
legacy O 
wooden O 
carousels O 
over O 
the O 
past O 
several O 
decades. O 
The O 
turn O 
of O 
the O 
new O 
millenium O 
actually O 
witnessesed O 
a O 
thaw O 
in O 
the O 
relationship O 
between O 
the O 
National ORG
Carousel ORG
Association ORG
and O 
American ORG
Carousel ORG
Society, ORG
as O 
newer O 
and O 
younger O 
leadership O 
took O 
over O 
from O 
the O 
founding O 
generation. O 
The O 
two O 
groups O 
decided O 
that O 
the O 
bickering O 
between O 
them O 
was O 
wasteful, O 
conterproductive O 
and O 
pointless. O 
There O 
was O 
talk O 
of O 
a O 
(re)merger O 
but O 
the O 
regulations O 
governing O 
non-profits O 
prevented O 
that. O 
However, O 
it O 
was O 
decided O 
that O 
NCA ORG
and O 
ACS ORG
hold O 
joint O 
conventions O 
to O 
save O 
on O 
costs O 
to O 
both O 
the O 
clubs O 
and O 
the O

Just O 
within O 
the O 
past O 
couple O 
of O 
months O 
though, O 
the O 
American ORG
Carousel ORG

had O 
determined O 
that O 
they O 
did O 
not O 
have O 
the O 
funding O 
to O 
continue O 
with O 
the O 
operation O

officially O 
ceased O

once O

there O

figure O 
staying O

Red O

which O 
isn't O 
far O

is O 
cheaper O 
then O 
staying O 
in O 
the O 
city. O 
Plus O 
while O 
driving O 
back O 
north O 
to O 
Boston O 
we O 
can O 
spend O 
the O 
day O 
in O 
NYC. O 
I O 
know O 
there's O 
WAY O 
too O 
much O 
to O 
do, O 
but O 
I O 
have O 
another O 
friend O 
who O 
works O 
at O 
the O 
MET O 
I'll O 
try O 
to O 
hook-up O 
with. O 
We'll O 
plan O 
our O 
few O 
hours O 
in O 
NYC O 
wisely. O 
Also O 
we're O 
hanging O 
in O 
Boston O 
for O 
so O 
many O 
nights O 
to O 
visit O 
with O 
the O 
friends O 
there O 
and O 
hit O 
the O 
sights O 
in O 
that O 
area. O 
Also O 
this O 
is O 
a O 
vacation, O 
so O 
we O 
hope O 
to O 
spend O 
some O 
time O 
just O 
chilling. O 
Any O 
suggestions O 
on O 
changes? O 
We O 
have O 
3 O 
people O 
going, O 
and O 
Expedia O 
shows O 
the O 
flight O 
(round O 
trip) O 
and O 
a O 
rental O 
car O 
with O 
unlimited O 
miles O 
being O 
$1430, O 
plus O 
I'm O 
figuring O 
about O 
$150 O 
for O 
gas O 
and O 
at O 
$120 O 
a O 
night O 
for O 
hotel O 
that's O 
$360 O 
total O 
for O 
that. O 
So O 
total O 
cost O 
(without O 
food, O 
spending O 
cash, O 
parking, O 
toll O 
roads, O 
etc) O 
is O 
$1910 O 
or O 
about O 
$637 O 
each. O 
I'm O 
figuring O 
about O 
$850 O 
per O 
person O 
should O 
be O 
plenty O 
for O 
everything O 
-- O 
and O 
that's O 
not O 
bad O 
for O 
7 O 
nights O 
in O 
New LOC
Enland LOC
with O 
all O 
the O 
stuff O 
we're O

Unless O 
there's O 
something O 
in O

you O

don't O

I O 
would O

Red O

wherever O 
and O 
trying O 
to O 
carve O 
out O 
an O 
extra O 
day O 
in O 
New O

You O 
can O

your O 
price O

with O 
three O

You O 
might O

to O 
drop O 
off O

as O 
soon O

you O 
arrive O 
in O

if O 
the O 
drop O 
off O 
charges O 
aren't O 
too O 
much. O 
Then O 
you O 
could O 
spend O 
part O

one O 
day O 
in O 
New O

(and O 
a O 
good O 
part O 
of O 
the O 
next O 
day, O

Toronto). O 
Then O 
you O 
could O 
take O 
the O 
train O

bus O 
back O 
to O 
Boston. O 
It O 
might O 
work O 
out O 
cheaper O 
in O 
the O

Hi O 
Everyone, O 
Thanks O 
for O 
all O 
the O 
great O 
replies!! O 
This O 
is O 
exactly O 
what O 
I'm O 
looking O 
for O 
:) O 
The O 
main O 
reason O 
I'd O 
like O 
to O 
goto O 
Toronto O 
and O 
Niagara O 
Falls O 
is O 
mainly O 
because O 
it's O 
so O 
close.. O 
but O 
I O 
agree O 
New O 
York O 
would O 
be O 
nice O 
to O 
spend O 
a O 
few O 
days O 
in. O 
I O 
know O 
the O 
bulk O 
of O 
our O 
trip O 
is O 
in O 
Boston, O 
but O 
we O 
have O 
friends O 
living O 
up O 
there O 
we O 
hope O 
to O 
spend O 
a O 
few O 
days O 
with O 
visiting. O 
The O 
trip O 
is O 
both O 
to O 
visit O 
with O 
them O 
and O 
to O 
spend O 
time O 
around O 
New LOC
England. LOC
As O 
for O 
gas, O 
what O 
is O 
the O 
going O 
rate O 
for O 
gas O 
right O 
now O 
in O 
New LOC
England? LOC
Here O 
in O 
Texas O 
it's O 
around O 
$1.60-$1.75 O 
for O 
Reg O 
Unleadded, O 
but O 
i'm O 
figuring O 
$1.90 O 
a O 
gallon. O 
Is O 
this O 
not O 
accurate? O 
Here's O 
how O 
I O 
figured O 
the O 
price O 
I'm O 
factoring O 
in O 
-- O 
Boston O 
to O 
Niagara O 
Falls O 
- O 
467 O 
Miles O 
Niagara O 
Falls O 
to O 
Toronto O 
- O 
85 O 
Miles O 
and O 
85 O 
Miles O 
back O 
Niagara O 
Falls O 
to O 
Red O 
Bank, O 
NJ O 
- O 
435 O 
Miles O 
Red O 
Bank, O 
NJ O 
to O 
Boston O 
(plus O 
spending O 
some O 
time O 
in O 
NYC) O 
- O 
262 O 
Total O 
is O 
1334, O 
but O 
I'm O 
figuring O 
1500 O 
with O 
some O 
extra O 
for O 
around O 
NYC O 
and O 
various O 
towns O 
we O 
visit. O 
We're O 
getting O 
a O 
mid-sized O 
vehicle, O 
so O 
if O 
the O 
car O 
gets O 
20 O 
mpg O 
that's O 
75 O 
gallons O 
used. O 
This O 
times O 
$1.90 O 
is O 
$145.50 O 
or O 
around O 
that. O 
Even O 
if O 
gas O 
is O 
$2.00 O 
a O 
gallon O 
that's O 
still O 
only O 
around O 
$150, O 
so O 
I O 
think O 
$200+ O 
for O 
gas O 
is O 
a O 
rather O 
high O 
estimate. O 
Also O 
is O 
it O 
possible O 
to O 
take O 
a O 
train O 
from O 
Boston O 
to O 
NYC? O 
If O 
so O 
how O 
does O 
that O 
work O 
or O 
what's O 
the O 
cost? O 
I O 
am O 
from O 
Texas O 
where O 
we O 
drive O 
everywhere, O 
and O 
I've O 
never O 
even O 
set O 
foot O 
on O 
a O 
train O 
-- O 
so O 
forgive O 
me O 
if O 
this O 
is O 
a O

question O

This O

The O

Ending O 
tyranny O

Well O 
that's O 
an O 
ambition, O 
and O 
if O

Jim, PER
The O 
Hmong PER
will O 
not O 
be O 
sitting O 
and O 
watching O 
from O 
the O

America O 
has O 
positioned O 
its O 
pieces O 
on O 
the O 
chess O 
board O 
of O 
global O 
domination O 
very O 
carefully. O 
Here O 
are O 
the O 
options: O 
1. O 
The O 
US O 
will O 
use O 
Hmong PER
American PER
sentiments O 
against O 
LPDR ORG
as O 
the O 
starting O 
point O 
for O 
a O 
regime O 
change O 
in O 
Laos. O 
However, O 
Laos O 
is O 
not O 
the O 
goal; O 
checkmate O 
is O 
the O 
fall O 
of O 
China, O 
and O 
economic O 
control O 
of O 
China. O 
The O 
US O 
will O 
support O 
one O 
or O 
two O 
Hmong PER
individuals O 
to O 
speak O 
out O 
against O 
LPDR ORG
human O 
rights O 
violation O 
and O 
Chao PER
Fa PER
resistance O 
fighters. O 
With O 
a O 
precedant O 
set O 
in O 
Iraq O 
for O 
preemptive O 
attacks, O 
Laos O 
will O 
be O 
taken O 
overnight O 
and O 
become O 
a O 
source O 
of O 
invaluable O 
logistics O 
for O 
U.S. O 
military O 
attacks O 
on O 
China. O 
2. O 
The O 
US's O 
policy O 
of O 
handing O 
out O 
NTR O 
will O 
have O 
the O 
desired O 
effect O 
of O 
reeling O 
in O 
alliances O 
from O 
the O 
surrounding O 
countries O 
of O 
China. O 
Laos O 
already O 
has O 
NTR. O 
We O 
shall O 
wait O 
and O 
see O 
if O 
Chinese O 
fat O 
or O 
American O 
fat O 
taste O 
better O 
to O 
LPDR. ORG
If O 
LPDR ORG
plays O 
ball O 
with O 
Uncle O 
Sam, O 
then O 
there O 
will O 
be O 
no O 
bloodshed O 
in O 
Laos. O 
When O 
the O 
Americans O 
get O 
into O 
Laos, O 
the O 
artificial O 
cooperation O 
will O 
be O 
sufficient O 
for O 
some O 
strategic O 
political O 
changes. O 
Some O 
Hmong O 
Americans O 
may O 
be O 
reintroduced O 
to O 
Laos. O 
Some O 
Hmong O 
in O 
Laos, O 
namely, O 
Chao PER
Fa, PER
will O 
be O 
a O 
good O 
source O 
of O 
intelligence O 
on O 
Lao-China O 
border O 
activities. O 
This O 
will O 
be O 
Chao PER
Fa's PER
chance O 
to O 
replace O 
their O 
diet O 
of O 
tree O 
roots O 
with O 
rice O 
and O 
fish. O 
Again, O 
America O 
has O 
LPDR ORG
under O 
its O 
control, O 
and O 
America O 
can O 
launch O 
airstrikes O 
and O 
ground O 
units O 
from O 
Laos. O 
3. O 
Regardless O 
of O 
what O 
happens, O 
the O 
U.S. O 
has O 
a O 
direct O 
ethnic O 
connection O 
to O 
China O 
by O 
way O 
of O 
Hmong, PER
which O 
will O 
secure O 
CIA-insurgency ORG
operations. O 
Unlike O 
the O 
current O 
situation O 
in O 
the O 
Middle-East, O 
where O 
the O 
number O 
of O 
Arabic-speaking O 
CIA ORG
agents O 
are O 
few, O 
there O 
will O 
be O 
plenty O 
of O 
Hmong/Chinese-speaking PER
CIA ORG
agents O 
for O 
disposal O 
and O 
use O 
in O 
the O 
looming O 
Sino-US O 
war. O 
Perhaps O 
by O 
route O 
of O 
Thailand, O 
if O 
LPDR ORG
does O 
not O 
cooperate, O 
the O 
US O 
will O 
incite O 
insurrection O 
in O 
the O 
southern O 
provinces O 
of O 
China. O 
These O 
provinces O 
have O 
a O 
lot O 
of O 
Hmong PER
people, O 
and O 
have O 
been O 
known O 
to O 
be O 
the O 
fiercest O 
opposition O 
to O 
Chinese O 
rule O 
(aka O 
Remember O 
the O 
Miao O 
Rebellions?). O 
This O 
will O 
be O 
the O 
Hmong's PER
God-given PER
chance O 
to O 
fight O 
for O 
their O 
own O 
country. O 
Let's O 
see O 
if O 
they O 
(and O 
we) O 
agree O 
to O 
a O 
coaltion O 
government O 
like O 
the O 
Kurds PER
in O 
Iraq. O 
Those O 
are O 
just O 
3 O 
options. O 
They O 
all O 
involve O 
Hmong PER
people. O 
Read O 
between O 
the O 
lines, O 
the O 
war O 
will O 
not O 
be O 
between O 
the O 
US O 
and O 
North O 
Korea. O 
China O 
is O 
using O 
North O 
Korea O 
to O 
escalate O 
Sino-US O 
relations O 
and O 
test O 
Uncle O 
Sam's O 
temper. O 
I O 
sure O 
hope O 
I O 
am O 
not O 
sitting O

watching O 
when O 
this O 
all O 
goes O

or O 
at O 
the O 
very O

a O 
war O 
against O

mainly O 
because O 
FDR PER
was O 
trying O 
to O 
provoke O 
Hitler PER
to O 
war O 
and O 
didn't O 
need O 
a O 
distraction O 
on O 
another O 
distant O

work? O 
(stuff O

The O 
thesis O 
has O 
been O 
expounded O 
by O 
several O 
conspiracy O 
theorists, O 
mainly O 
the O 
ones O 
who O 
expounded O 
that O 
FDR PER
knew O 
Pearl O 
Harbor O 
was O 
about O 
to O 
be O 
attacked, O 
and O 
let O 
it O 
happen. O 
One O 
of O 
their O 
"proofs" O 
was O 
that O 
the O 
US O 
carriers O 
were O 
out O 
of O 
port O 
during O 
the O 
attack, O 
and O 
"everybody O 
knew" O 
carriers O 
were O 
the O 
capital O 
ship O 
of O 
the O 
future. O 
However, O 
the O 
two O 
carriers O 
operating O 
out O 
of O 
Pearl O 
at O 
the O 
moment O 
were O 
sent O 
West O 
with O 
light O 
escort, O 
on O 
possibly O 
intersecting O 
routes O 
with O 
the O 
IJN ORG
Kido O 
Butai, O 
which O 
had O 
far O 
more O 
carriers O 
and O 
a O 
far O 
heavier O 
escort. O 
Even O 
stranger, O 
the O 
USS O 
Enterprise O 
was O 
scheduled O 
to O 
be O 
at O 
Pearl O 
by O 
Dec O 
6th, O 
but O 
got O 
delayed O 
by O 
a O 
storm. O 
Consequently, O 
for O 
the O 
PH O 
conspiracy O 
theorists O 
to O 
believe O 
that O 
FDR PER
kept O 
the O 
carriers O 
out O 
of O 
harm's O 
way, O 
we O 
not O 
only O

to O 
grant O 
FDR PER
the O 
full O 
knowledge O

Kido O

route O

approach O 
would O 
not O 
result O 
in O 
either O 
USN ORG
carrier O 
fleet O

that O

the O 
West O 
was O 
able O 
to O 
carve O 
up O 
China O 
into O 
"Spheres O

and O 
was O 
able O 
to O

from O

had O 
had O 
limited O 
success O 
in O 
their O 
previous O 
attempts O 
to O 
dominate O 
the O 
Korean O 
peninsula, O 
much O 
less O 
China. O 
As O 
part O 
of O 
the O 
catch-up O 
effort, O 
she O 
whole-heartedly O 
entered O 
into O 
the O 
Imperialist O 
game O 
in O 
Asia, O 
being O 
treated O 
as O 
an O 
equal O 
(relative O 
to O 
her O 
power) O 
by O 
the O 
other O 
powers. O 
However, O 
after O 
World O 
War O 
I, O 
Japan O 
failed O 
to O 
recognize O 
a O 
fundamental O 
shift O 
in O 
the O 
attitudes O 
of O 
her O 
former O 
Imperial O 
partners; O 
they O 
began O 
a O 
long, O 
slow O 
process O 
of O 
disengaging O 
themselves O 
from O 
their O 
former O 
Imperial O 
areas, O 
from O 
their O 
colonies, O 
in O 
addition O 
to O 
outright O 
stopping O 
all O 
expansions. O 
Japan O 
chose O 
to O 
read O 
this O 
as O 
a O 
sign O 
that O 
the O 
West O 
had O 
lost O 
its O 
power O 
and O 
resolve, O 
and O 
that O 
Japan O 
was O 
the O 
rightful O 
heir O 
to O 
Imperial O 
mantle O 
in O 
Asia. O 
With O 
the O 
deaths O 
of O 
many O 
of O 
the O 
idealistic O 
leaders O 
who O 
had O 
led O 
Japan's O 
rise O 
to O 
international O 
prominence, O 
and O 
the O 
refusal O 
of O 
the O 
US O 
to O 
intervene O 
in O 
Asian O 
affairs, O 
in O 
addition O 
to O 
the O 
Bolshevik PER
revolution O 
and O 
the O 
stripping O 
of O 
possessions O 
from O 
Germany, O 
Britain O 
found O 
herself O 
alone O 
in O 
dealing O 
with O 
an O 
increasingly O 
aggressive O 
Japan O 
in O 
the O 
area. O 
Having O 
a O 
keen O 
grasp O 
of O 
the O 
obvious, O 
she O 
began O 
a O 
policy O 
of O 
acceding O 
to O 
Japanese O 
hegemony O 
in O 
the O 
area. O 
Japan O 
continued O 
a O 
policy O 
of O 
acquiring O 
territory O 
for O 
some O 
grand, O 
illusive O 
scheme O 
of O 
a O 
"Greater LOC
Asia", LOC
subordinate O 
and O 
grateful O 
to O 
Japan. O 
The O 
reality O 
of O 
this O 
was O 
that O 
only O 
a O 
single O 
possession, O 
Manchuria, LOC
was O 
profitable O 
to O 
the O 
Japanese, O 
and O 
the O 
rest O 
of O 
the O 
Empire O 
turned O 
out O 
to O 
be O 
a O 
drain. O 
This O 
drain O 
was O 
greatly O 
accelerated O 
by O 
Japan's O 
invasion O 
of O 
China O 
proper O 
in O 
1936. O 
It O 
was O 
a O 
war O 
that O 
Japan O 
assumed O 
would O 
be O 
ended O 
in O 
"3 O 
to O 
6 O 
months"; O 
at O 
the O 
time O 
of O 
Pearl O 
Harbor, O 
it O 
had O 
been O 
going O 
on O 
for O 
5 O 
years, O 
at O 
the O 
cost O 
of O 
over O 
half O 
a O 
million O 
Japanese O 
lives. O 
The O 
war O 
put O 
a O 
tremendous O 
strain O 
on O 
Japan O 
(and O 
was O 
in O 
fact O 
opposed O 
by O 
more O 
radically O 
NATIONALISTIC O 
elements, O 
as O 
taking O 
away O 
from O 
the O 
development O 
of O 
Japan's O 
other O 
possessions, O 
particularly O 
in O 
the O 
areas O 
of O 
scrap O 
metal O 
and O 
fuel.) O 
Domestic O 
consumption O 
fell, O 
consumer O 
goods O 
became O 
scarce, O 
and O 
the O 
use O 
of O 
materiale O 
for O 
war O 
purposes O 
ate O 
into O 
Japan's O 
domestic O 
industry. O 
This O 
cut O 
further O 
into O 
her O 
foreign O 
reserves, O 
exacerbating O 
the O 
economic O 
impact O 
of O 
the O 
war. O 
The O 
war O 
effort O 
took O 
on O 
a O 
life O 
of O 
its O 
own, O 
however, O 
and O 
common O 
sense O 
was O 
subordinated O 
to O 
it. O 
Japan O 
expanded O 
into O 
areas O 
of O 
China O 
and O 
Indochina O 
which O 
had O 
no O 
strategic O 
value O 
to O 
her, O 
but O 
put O 
her O 
in O 
a O 
position O 
to O 
threaten O 
British O 
and O 
Dutch O 
possessions O 
in O 
the O 
area; O 
possessions O 
that O 
both O 
those O 
Allied O 
nations O 
needed O 
in O 
order O 
to O 
continue O 
their O 
fight O 
against O 
Hitler. PER
At O 
this O 
point, O 
the O 
US O 
stopped O 
ignoring O 
the O 
Japanese O 
threat, O 
and O 
imposed O 
a O 
series O 
of O 
escalating O 
sanctions O 
on O 
Japan, O 
cutting O 
off O 
her O 
scrap O 
metal, O 
limitting O 
and O 
then O 
cutting O 
off O 
her O 
oil O 
(Japan O 
imported O 
most O 
of O 
both O 
from O 
the O 
US.) O 
While O 
Japanese O 
officials O 
realized O 
that O 
they O 
had O 
enough O 
of O 
each O 
resource O 
for O 
Japan O 
to O 
do O 
well O 
IF O 
THE O 
WAR O 
IN O 
CHINA O 
STOPPED, O 
they O 
were O 
powerless O 
over O 
the O 
military O 
they O 
were O 
supposed O 
to O 
control. O 
An O 
abortive O 
attack O 
on O 
Soviet O 
positions O 
in O 
Mongolia O 
had O 
placed O 
Japan's O 
focus O 
firmly O 
south, O 
towards O 
the O 
possessions O 
of O 
the O 
US' O 
future O 
allies. O 
For O 
no O 
reason O 
anyone O 
could O 
articulate, O 
Japan O 
felt O 
she O 
had O 
to O 
continue O 
the O 
war O 
in O 
China. O 
To O 
continue O 
the O 
war O 
in O 
China, O 
she O 
had O 
to O 
have O 
resources O 
of O 
oil O 
and O 
metal. O 
To O 
have O 
these O 
resources, O 
she O 
must O 
seize O 
them, O 
if O 
others O 
refused O 
to O 
sell O 
them. O 
In O 
order O 
to O 
seize O 
them, O 
she O 
felt O 
she O 
had O 
to O 
attack O 
and O 
destroy O 
the O 
naval O 
power O 
of O 
the O 
US. O 
Thus, O 
for O 
a O 
"3 O 
to O 
6 O 
month" O 
operation O 
in O 
China O 
in O 
1937, O 
Japan O 
would O 
embark O 
on O 
a O 
war O 
that O 
would O 
strip O 
her O 
of O 
all O 
the O 
possessions O

all O

Hello O

I'm O

trying O

some O 
perspective. O 
The O 
Holocaust O 
of O 
the O 
Jews PER

was O 
motivated O 
by O 
racial O 
prejudices. O 
The O 
murder O 
of O 
(at O 
the O 
most) O 
10k O 
homosexuals O 
wasn't. O 
Most O 
homosexuals O 
arrested O 
during O 
the O 
Nazi PER
era O 
were O 
imprisoned O 
in O 
normal O 
jails. O 
If O 
you O

did O 
nothing O 
with O 
it O 
the O

couldn't O 
touch O 
you. O 
The O 
Jews O

Zigeuner O 
on O 
the O 
other O 
hand O 
were O 
killed O 
simply O 
for O 
their O

that O

as O 
for O

accused O

the O 
10-year O

certain O 
"assault O

signed O 
by O 
President O

The O 
ban O 
expired O

at O 
the O 
time O

no O

let's O 
talk O 
about O 
this O 
case, O 
as O 
I'm O 
sure O 
discussions O 
have O 
started O 
and O 
many O 
want O 
stronger O 
gun O 
control O 
because O 
of O 
this O 
freak O

While O 
the O 
media O 
use O 
words O 
like O 
"military O 
style," O 
"assault" O 
and O 
"semiautomatic," O 
the O 
gun O 
used O 
in O 
the O 
slayings O 
was O 
not O 
unlike O 
a O 
typical O 
hunting O 
rifle. O 
The O 
SKS O 
is O 
a O 
medium-powered O 
carbine O 
equipped O 
with O 
a O 
10-round O 
magazine, O 
just O 
like O 
the O

I'm O

Banned O 
weapons O 
had O 
capacities O

more O 
than O 
10 O 
rounds; O 
so O 
like O 
my O 
small O 
9mm, O 
the O 
SKS O 
was O 
not O 
classified O 
as O 
an O 
"assault" O

So O 
let's O 
not O 
center O 
our O

the O

let's O 
talk O 
about O 
the O

Ms. O

the O 
anti-abortion O

convice O 
(sic) O 
nearly O 
everyone O 
that O 
abortion O 
is O 
wrong O

feel O 
horribly O

we O

Yes, O 
only O 
the O

value O 
life O 
when O 
it's O 
a O 
life O

Of O

it O 
would O 
be O 
wrong O 
to O

"horribly O

celebrating O 
the O

The O

that O

Even O 
by O

it O

it's O

And O 
because O

such O

- O

citizens O

prohibited O

- O 
a O

can O 
use O 
bag-toting O

you O 
lose O 
the O

the O

probably O 
deep-six O 
this O 
5-year O 
mandatory O 
requirement O

compensation O 
due O

relocation. O 
If O 
not O 
bordering O 
on O 
the O 
political O 
ridorkulous O 
(ridiculously O 
dorky), O 
it's O 
just O 
plain O 
ludicrous O 
to O 
believe O

but O 
it's O 
not O

The O 
Commonwealth O 
needs O

mandatory O

Plan O 
(ESOP) O 
within O 
the O 
contractual O 
economic O 
development O

The O 
ESOP O 
is O 
itself O 
a O 
corporate O 
finance O 
vehicle O 
that O 
provides O 
monetary O 
incentives O 
with O

More O

will O 
drive O 
our O

But O 
most O

how O 
many O 
Virginia O 
businesses O 
will O 
choose O 
to O 
relocate O

outsource O 
when O 
employee O

lets O

the O 
business O 
has O 
no O 
other O 
choice O

to O 
remove O

the O 
third O

... O 
When O 
Virginia's O 
employees O 
are O 
fully O 
vested O

they O

also O 
reap O

Currently, O

advocated O

a O 
way O 
that O 
serves O

He O 
has O 
suggested O 
that O 
we O 
either O 
increase O 
membership O 
in O 
the O 
Senate ORG
to O 
50, O 
or O 
decrease O 
House ORG
membership O 
to O 
80, O 
producing O 
a O 
scenario O 
wherein O 
1 O 
Senator O 
would O 
represent O 
a O 
block O 
of O 
people O 
who O 
are O 
represented O 
by O 
exactly O 
2 O

He O 
thinks--and O

this O

foster O

thousands O

while O 
getting O 
yanked O

not O 
to O

he's O 
paying O 
the O 
government O 
thousands O 
in O

He O 
gets O 
very O 
frustrated O 
because O 
many O 
of O 
his O 
contemporaries O 
work O 
for O 
cash O 
under O 
the O 
table. O 
They O 
aren't O 
paying O 
lawyers, O 
and O 
they O 
pay O 
nothing O 
into O 
the O 
system. O 
Of O 
course, O 
the O 
Americans O 
who O 
employ O 
illegal O 
immigrants O 
are O 
happy O 
to O 
pay O 
in O 
cash O 
because O 
it O 
means O 
cheaper O 
labor O 
for O 
them. O 
Who O 
benefits? O 
The O 
illegal O 
immigrants O 
themselves, O 
of O 
course. O 
The O 
employers O 
who O 
hire O 
them O 
instead O 
of O 
raising O 
wages O 
to O 
attract O 
native-born O 
Americans O 
and O 
legal O 
immigrants. O 
And O 
families O 
who O 
hire O 
cheap O 
domestic O 
labor, O 
whether O 
to O 
clean O 
the O 
house, O 
wash O 
the O 
laundry O 
or O 
maintain O 
the O 
lawn. O 
Who O 
loses? O 
Poor, O 
native-born O 
Americans O 
who O 
otherwise O 
would O 
be O 
paid O 
higher O 
wages O 
for O 
their O 
manual O 
labor. O 
Legal O 
immigrants O 
like O 
my O 
Brazilian O 
friend, O 
who O 
sometimes O 
feels O 
like O 
a O 
sap O 
for O 
playing O 
by O 
the O 
rules. O 
And O 
the O 
rest O 
of O 
us O 
who O 
won't O 
hire O 
anyone O 
to O 
work O 
for O 
us O 
unless O 
they're O 
paying O 
their O 
taxes, O 
even O 
if O 
it O 
means O 
we O 
pay O 
more. O 
Yeah, O 
I've O 
got O 
a O 
problem O 
with O 
turning O 
around O

giving O 
illegal O 
immigrants O 
all O

. O 
. O 
. O 
And O 
I O 
will O 
also O 
say O 
this O 
to O 
you: O 
There O 
are O 
people O 
dying O 
in O 
Iraq, O 
but O 
the O 
reason O 
people O 
are O 
dying O 
is O 
because O 
of O 
the O 
terrorism O 
and O 
the O 
intimidation O 
and O 
the O 
people O 
who O 
are O 
deliberately O 
killing O 
anyone O 
trying O 
to O 
make O 
this O 
country O 
better. O 
Now O 
what O 
should O 
our O 
response O 
be O 
as O 
an O 
international O 
community? O 
Our O 
response O 
should O 
be O 
to O 
stand O 
alongside O 
the O 
democrats--the O 
people O 
who've O 
got O 
the O 
courage O 
to O 
see O 
this O 
thing O 
through--and O 
help O 
them O 
see O 
it O 
through. O 
I've O 
got O 
no O 
doubt O 
at O 
all O 
that O 
that O 
is O 
the O 
right O 
thing O 
for O 
us O 
to O 
do. O 
. O 
. O 
. O 
Sometimes O 
when O 
I O 
see O 
some O 
of O 
the O 
reporting O 
of O 
what's O 
happening O 
in O 
Iraq O 
in O 
the O 
rest O 
of O 
the O 
world, O 
I O 
just O 
feel O 
that O 
people O 
should O 
understand O 
how O 
precious O 
what O 
has O 
been O 
created O 
here O 
is. O 
And O 
those O 
people O 
from O 
that O 
electoral O 
commission O 
that O 
I O 
described O 
as O 
the O 
heroes O 
of O 
the O 
new O 
Iraq--every O 
day O 
. O 
. O 
. O 
a O 
lot O 
of O 
them O 
aren't O 
living O 
in O 
the O 
Green LOC
Zone, LOC
they've O 
got O 
to O 
travel O 
in O 
from O 
outside. O 
They O 
do O 
not O 
know O 
at O 
any O 
point O 
in O 
time O 
whether O 
they're O 
going O 
to O 
be O 
subject O 
to O 
brutality O 
or O 
intimidation, O 
even O 
death, O 
and O 
yet O 
they O 
carry O 
on O 
doing O 
it. O 
Now O 
what O 
a O 
magnificent O 
example O 
of O 
the O 
human O 
spirit--that's O 
the O 
side O 
we O 
should O 
be O 
on. O

Question O 
Curt O 
2004-12-30T18:44:00 O 
This O 
recent O 
news O 
story O 
is O 
troubling O 
in O 
many O 
different O 
ways. O 
When O 
I O 
first O 
heard O 
of O 
the O 
story O 
I O 
figured O 
it O 
was O 
some O 
wackjob O 
playing O 
with O 
a O 
new O 
toy O 
but O 
now O 
we O 
find O 
out O 
there O 
have O 
been O 
7 O 
incidents O 
since O 
Christmas O 
from O 
the O 
West O 
to O 
East O 
coast. O 
The O 
FBI, ORG
concerned O 
that O 
terrorists O 
could O 
use O 
lasers O 
as O 
weapons, O 
is O 
investigating O 
why O 
laser O 
beams O 
were O 
directed O 
into O 
the O 
cockpits O 
of O 
seven O 
airplanes O 
in O 
flight O 
since O 
Christmas. O 
Laser O 
beams O 
can O 
temporarily O 
blind O 
or O 
disorient O 
pilots O 
and O 
possibly O 
cause O 
a O 
plane O 
to O 
crash. O 
The O 
FBI ORG
is O 
looking O 
into O 
two O 
incidents O 
in O 
Colorado O 
Springs, O 
Colo., O 
and O 
one O 
each O 
in O 
Cleveland, O 
Washington, O 
Houston, O 
Teterboro, O

Medford, O

according O

officials, O 
some O 
of O 
whom O 
spoke O 
only O 
on O 
condition O 
of O 
anonymity. O 
A O 
federal O 
law O 
enforcement O 
official, O 
who O 
declined O 
to O 
be O 
identified O 
by O 
name, O 
said O 
Thursday O 
there O 
is O 
no O 
evidence O 
of O 
a O 
plot O 
or O 
terrorist O 
activity. O 
But O 
pilots O 
are O 
troubled O 
by O 
the O 
incidents, O 
and O 
the O 
FBI ORG
earlier O 
this O

warned O 
of O 
the O 
possibility O 
that O 
terrorists O 
might O 
use O 
the O 
devices O 
as O 
weapons. O 
"It's O 
not O 
some O

"It's O

organized." O 
Loren PER
Thompson, PER
who O 
teaches O

at O 
Georgetown ORG

called O 
it O 
a O 
"rather O 
worrisome O 
development," O 
though O 
he O 
said O 
experts O 
would O 
be O 
more O 
puzzled O 
than O 
alarmed. O 
"What O 
we're O 
talking O 
about O 
is O 
a O 
fairly O 
powerful O 
visible O 
light O 
laser O 
that O 
has O 
the O 
ability O 
to O 
lock O 
onto O 
a O 
fast-moving O 
aircraft," O 
Thompson PER

"That's O 
not O 
the O 
sort O 
of O 
thing O 
you O 
pick O 
up O 
at O

that O 
could O 
do O 
the O 
things O 
the O 
FBI ORG
suspects O 
would O 
be O 
"fairly O 
expensive O 
and O 
fairly O 
sophisticated." O 
"It O 
sounds O 
like O 
an O 
organized O

to O 
cause O 
airline O

Michelle PER

has O 
a O 
post O 
about O 
this O 
today O 
where O 
some O 
outlets O 
have O 
stopped O 
selling O 
lasers. O 
Lots O

think O 
that O 
these O 
indeed O 
might O 
be O 
loonies O 
playing O 
with O

but O 
I O 
disagree. O 
These O 
are O 
incidents O 
where O 
the O 
Airplanes O 
were O 
tracked O 
, O 
some O 
as O 
high O 
as O 
8500 O 
feet. O 
To O 
track O 
a O 
fast O

at O 
that O

In O 
my O 
opinion O 
this O 
is O 
quite O 
alarming. O 
This O

a O 
ton O 
of O 
info, O 
some O 
of O 
it O 
quite O 
scary O 
A O 
more O 
frightening O 
scenario O 
is O 
that O 
terrorists O 
may O 
have O 
obtained O 
a O 
Chinese-produced O 
ZM-87 O 
laser O 
blinder O 
which O 
is O 
specifically O 
designed O 
to O 
blind O

The O 
Japanese O 
terrorist O 
cult O 
Aum ORG
Shinrikyo--which ORG
launched O 
the O 
infamous O 
Sarin O 
gas O 
attack O 
on O 
the O 
Tokyo O

system O 
in O 
1995--was O 
discovered O

with O 
the O

to O 
The O

"Cult O

PoliticAlex PER
also O 
has O 
some O 
info O 
on O 
this O 
story O 
also. O 
I O 
found O 
the O 
following O 
report O 
that O 
was O 
presented O 
to O 
Congress ORG
recently O 
about O 
the O 
shoulder O 
launched O 
missle O 
threat O 
to O 
airliners, O 
which O 
this O 
might O 
very O 
well O 
be O 
a O 
precursor O 
to: O 
Recent O 
events O 
have O 
focused O 
attention O 
on O 
the O 
threat O 
that O 
terrorists O 
with O 
shoulder O 
fired O 
surface-to-air O 
missiles O 
(SAMs), O 
referred O 
to O 
as O 
Man-Portable O 
Air O 
Defense O 
Systems O 
(MANPADS), O 
pose O 
to O 
commercial O 
airliners. O 
Most O 
believe O 
that O 
no O 
single O 
solution O 
exists O 
to O 
effectively O 
mitigate O 
this O 
threat. O 
Instead, O 
a O 
menu O 
of O 
options O 
may O 
be O 
considered, O 
including O 
installing O 
infrared O 
(IR) O 
countermeasures O 
on O 
aircraft; O 
modifying O 
flight O 
operations O 
and O 
air O 
traffic O 
control O 
procedures; O 
improving O 
airport O 
and O 
regional O 
security; O 
and O 
strengthening O 
missile O 
non-proliferation O 
efforts. O 
Equipping O 
aircraft O 
with O 
missile O 
countermeasure O 
systems O 
can O 
protect O 
the O 
aircraft O 
even O 
when O 
operating O 
in O 
areas O 
where O 
ground-based O 
security O 
measures O 
are O 
unavailable O 
or O 
infeasible O 
to O 
implement. O 
However, O 
this O 
option O 
has O 
a O 
relatively O 
high O 
cost, O 
between O 
$1 O 
million O 
and O 
$3 O 
million O 
per O 
aircraft, O 
and O 
the O 
time O 
needed O 
for O 
implementation O 
does O 
not O 
allow O 
for O 
immediate O 
response O 
to O 
the O 
existing O 
terrorist O 
threat. O 
Procedural O 
improvements O 
such O 
as O 
specific O 
flight O 
crew O 
training, O 
altering O 
air O 
traffic O 
procedures O 
to O 
minimize O 
exposure O 
to O 
the O 
threat, O 
and O 
improved O 
security O 
near O 
airports O 
may O 
be O 
less O 
costly O 
than O 
countermeasures O 
and O 
could O 
more O 
immediately O 
help O 
deter O 
domestic O 
terrorist O 
attacks. O 
However, O 
these O 
techniques O 
by O 
themselves O 
cannot O 
completely O 
mitigate O 
the O 
risk O 
of O 
domestic O 
attacks O 
and O 
would O 
not O 
protect O 
U.S. O 
airliners O 
flying O 
to O 
and O 
from O 
foreign O 
airports. O 
Legislation O 
introduced O 
in O 
the O 
108th O 
Congress O 
(H.R. O 
580, O 
S. O 
311) O 
calls O 
for O 
the O 
installation O 
of O 
missile O 
defense O 
systems O 
in O 
all O 
turbojet O 
aircraft O 
used O 
in O 
scheduled O 
air O 
carrier O 
service. O 
While O 
this O 
legislation O 
is O 
still O 
under O 
consideration, O 
Homeland ORG

appropriations O 
designated O 
$60 O 
million O

FY2004 O

countermeasure O 
systems O 
for O 
commercial O 
aircraft O 
based O

is O

For O 
the O

for O

That O 
another O 
reason O 
why O 
I O 
respect O

his O 
refusal O

that O 
windbag O

May O

rot O

But O 
since O 
Arafat's PER
death, O 
Europeans O

Americans O 
have O 
been O 
able O 
to O 
find O 
common O 
ground: O 
supporting O 
Ariel PER

withdrawal O 
from O

putting O 
pressure O

Israel O

hold O 
elections O 
and, O 
covertly, O 
backing O 
Mahmoud PER
Abbas PER
to O 
become O 
the O 
next O 
Palestinian O 
leader. O 
A O 
second O 
reason O 
is O 
Europe's O 
growing O 
worries O 
about O 
Islamic PER
terrorism. O 
The O 
murder O 
in O 
November O 
of O 
Theo PER

a O 
provocative O 
Dutch O 
filmmaker, O 
at O 
the O 
hands O 
of O 
an O 
Islamic PER
militant O 
has O 
been O 
called O 
Europe's O 
9/11. O 
Though O 
the O 
two O 
events O 
are O 
obviously O 
not O 
fully O 
comparable, O 
it O 
is O 
certainly O 
true O 
that O 
American O 
conservatives, O 
such O 
as O 
Francis PER
Fukuyama PER
and O 
Bernard PER
Lewis, PER
have O 
found O 
a O 
wider O 
audience O 
recently O 
for O 
the O 
idea O 
that O 
radical O 
Islam O 
is O 
inimical O 
to O 
European O 
traditions O 
of O 
tolerance. O 
You O 
mean O 
those O 
radical O 
muslims O 
can O 
be O 
kinda O 
nasty O 
sometimes? O 
Get O 
outta O

doing O 
business O

they O 
will O 
more O 
then O 
likely O 
have O 
their O 
very O 
own O 
9/11 O 
to O 
cry O 
about. O 
The O 
third O 
force O 
is O 
the O 
reappearance, O 
albeit O 
in O 
a O 
milder O 
form, O 
of O 
the O 
threat O 
that O 
kept O 
the O 
trans-Atlantic O 
alliance O 
together O 
for O 
half O 
a O

edge O 
to O 
all O 
this. O

as O 
the O 
snooty O 
continentals O 
eventually O

is O 
a O 
grudging O

Many O

His O

A O 
fascinating O 
part O

how O

to O 
gloss O 
over O 
Annan's PER
role O 
in O 
the O 
1994 O 
genocide O 
in O 
Rwanda. O 
She O 
tries O 
to O 
blame O 
the O 
U.S. O 
and O 
other O 
members O 
of O 
the O 
Security ORG
Council ORG
for O 
not O 
sending O 
enough O 
troops O 
to O

She O 
admits, O 
however, O 
that, O 
"The O 
Rwanda O 
massacres O 
occurred O 
while O 
Annan PER
was O 
U.N. ORG
Undersecretary O 
General O 
for O 
peacekeeping," O 
and O 
that O 
"After O 
he O 
became O 
SG PER
[Secretary O 
General], O 
Annan PER
commissioned O 
a O 
report O 
to O 
examine O 
what O 
had O 
happened O 
and O 
suggest O 
remedies." O 
Later, O 
"Annan PER
accepted O 
responsibility O 
for O 
failing O 
to O 
act O 
more O 
quickly," O 
she O 
writes. O 
But O 
responsibility O 
for O 
what? O 
The O 
truth O 
is O 
that, O 
as O 
director O 
of O 
U.N. ORG
peacekeeping, O 
Annan PER
personally O 
refused O 
requests O 
to O 
authorize O 
U.N. ORG
peacekeepers O 
in O 
Rwanda O 
to O 
seize O 
weapons O 
and O 
prevent O 
genocide. O 
Writer O 
and O 
author O 
Philip PER
Gourevitch PER
has O 
described O 
in O 
detail O 
how, O 
three O 
months O 
before O 
the O 
genocide, O 
Major O 
General O 
Romeo PER
Dallaire, PER
the O 
commander O 
of O 
several O 
thousand O 
U.N. ORG
troops O 
in O 
Rwanda, O 
sent O 
a O 
fax O 
to O 
Kofi PER
Annan's PER
office, O 
saying O 
he O 
had O 
received O 
evidence O 
from O 
a O 
Rwandan O 
government O 
informant O 
that O 
genocide O 
was O 
being O 
planned. O 
The O 
informant O 
offered O 
to O 
help O 
U.N. ORG
forces O 
in O 
raiding O 
the O 
government O 
stockpiles O 
to O 
be O 
used O 
in O 
the O 
genocide O 
campaign. O 
All O 
that O 
the O 
informant O 
wanted O 
in O 
return O 
was O 
protection O 
for O 
himself O 
and O 
his O 
family. O 
But O 
the O 
general O 
needed O 
U.N. ORG
authorization O 
to O 
conduct O 
such O 
a O 
raid O 
and O 
save O 
lives. O 
He O 
asked O 
for O 
that O 
approval O 
but O 
the O 
answer O 
came O 
back O 
in O 
a O 
now-infamous O 
"genocide O 
fax" O 
from O 
Annan's PER
office. O 
It O 
denied O 
authorization O 
for O 
the O 
mission O 
and O 
told O 
him O 
that O 
he O 
should O 
turn O 
the O 
information O 
provided O 
by O 
the O 
confidential O 
witness O 
over O 
to O 
the O 
Rwandan O 
government O 
which O 
was O 
planning O 
the O 
genocide! O 
The O 
result O 
was O 
that O 
the O 
information O 
dried O 
up O 
and O 
the O 
genocide O 
took O 
place. O 
Yup, O 
good O 
ole O 
Kofi PER
told O 
this O 
poor O 
guy O 
to O 
give O 
the O 
secret O 
info O 
over O 
to O 
the O 
very O 
government O 
that O 
was O 
planning O 
the O 
genocide. O 
What O 
a O

he O 
is O 
isn't O 
he. O 
Or O 
how O 
about O 
the O 
ongoing O 
prostitution O 
that's O 
going O 
on O

the O

The O 
article O 
ends O 
with O 
the O 
following: O 
In O 
an O 
April O 
30, O 
2001, O 
Washington ORG
Times ORG
column, O 
Nat PER
Hentoff PER
noted O 
that O 
the O

have O 
devoted O 
"scant O 
mention" O 
to O 
the O 
"plain O 
fact O 
that O 
it O 
was O 
Mr. O 
Annan, PER
when O 
he O 
was O 
head O 
of O 
the O 
United ORG
Nation's ORG
peacekeeping O 
office, O 
who O 
could O 
have O 
prevented O 
the O 
slaughter O 
of O 
800,000 O 
Tutsis O 
and O 
their O 
sympathizers O 
in O 
Rwanda O 
in O 
1994." O 
It's O 
true, O 
Hentoff PER
said, O 
that O 
the O 
U.N. ORG
issued O 
a O 
report O 
in O 
1999 O 
that O 
acknowledged, O 
to O 
some O 
extent, O 
its O 
role O 
in O 
the O 
killings. O 
But O 
for O 
five O 
and O 
a O 
half O 
years, O 
he O 
noted, O 
Annan PER
"refused O 
to O 
accept O 
any O 
responsibility O 
for O 
the O 
Rwandan O 
holocaust O 
until O 
Mr. O 
Gourevitch PER

others O

that O 
less O

5,000 O

have O 
stopped O 
the O 
killings O 
if O 
Mr. O

It O 
is O 
astonishing O 
that O 
a O 
journalist O 
for O 
NBC ORG
New O 
would O 
close O 
her O 
eyes O 
to O 
Annan's PER

that O 
is O 
what O 
she O 
was O 
apparently O

do. O

Some O

the O

go O 
along O

because O

But O 
as O 
The O 
Captain PER

out, O 
it O 
probably O

more O 
to O

with O 
Iran: O 
I O 
suspect O 
the O

the O 
reluctance O 
comes O 
not O 
from O 
the O 
"delicate" O

E.g., O 
Mischie, PER

on O

political O 
personality O

the O 
19th O

Mischie PER
bought O 
the O 
house O 
where O

paper's O

Maybe O 
he O 
tried O 
to O 
invest O

he O

poor O 
innocent O

his O

using O 
a O

Another O

Mischie PER

declared O

of O 
emergency O 
in O

excluding O 
the O

this O

a O 
necessary O 
step O 
that O 
should O 
have O 
been O 
taken O 
at O

Suicide O

carried O 
out O 
by O 
insurgents O

foreign O 
terrorists O 
based O

have O 
escalated O 
to O 
alarming O

during O

Deputy O 
governor O 
of O 
Diyala O 
along O 
with O 
several O 
council O 
members O 
from O 
Ba'quba O 
were O 
ambushed O 
and O 
killed O 
in O 
Latifiya O 
south O

Baghdad, O 
an O 
area O 
which O 
has O 
supposedly O 
been O 
'cleared' O 
from O 
insurgents O 
a O 
couple O

weeks O

Four O 
suicide O

in O 
Samarra, O 
also O 
a O 
recently O 
'liberated' O 
area, O 
against O 
National ORG
Guard ORG
units O 
and O 
the O 
governorate O 
building. O 
Zarqawi's PER
group O 
claimed O 
responsibility O 
for O 
the O 
attacks. O 
Three O 
police O 
stations O 
in O 
Haditha, O 
a O 
small O 
town O 
west O 
of O 
Ramadi, O 
were O 
assaulted O

Some O 
30 O

captured, O 
tied O 
up O

executed O 
in O 
cold O 
blood O 
against O

following O 
a O

two O

Zarqawi's PER

again, O

A O 
full-scale O 
military O 
operation O 
against O 
Fallujah, O 
which O 
is O 
apparently O

already, O 
seems O 
to O 
be O 
the O 
government's O 
'final O

I'm O 
not O 
optimistic O 
to O 
the O 
outcome, O 
especially O 
when O 
significant O

unavoidable. O 
Note, O 
that O 
I'm O 
not O 
suggesting O 
a O 
peaceful O 
or O 
political O 
solution O 
would O 
work O 
either O 
in O 
these O 
areas. O 
Insurgents O 
west O 
of O 
Baghdad O 
have O 
quite O 
obstinately O 
made O 
it O 
clear O 
that O 
nothing O 
but O 
full O 
control O 
of O 
the O 
country, O 
or O 
at O

the O 
Anbar O 
governorate, O 
will O 
satisfy O 
them. O 
They O 
have O 
refused O 
to O 
participate O 
in O 
the O 
political O 
process, O 
they O 
have O 
repeatedly O

their O 
intentions O 
to O 
boycott O 
the O

and O 
to O 
disrupt O 
them O 
in O

The O 
demands O 
of O 
the O 
Fallujah O 
negotiants O 
from O 
the O

weeks O

obscene O

The O

it O

that O 
owned O 
oil O

I O

this O

what O 
I O

Indiana's O 
eastern O

doesn't O 
use O 
it. O 
What's O 
THAT O 
all O 
about? O 
Arizona O 
doesn't O 
use O 
it O 
because O 
one O 
tribe O 
of O 
Indians PER
stretches O 
into O 
three O

But O 
those O 
other O

DO O 
use O 
it. O 
Hawaii O

all. O 
Of O 
course, O 
they're O 
closer O

to O 
us, O

since O

it, O 
Hawaii O 
just O

along. O 
(Do O 
you O 
think O 
the O 
Hawaiian's O 
sit O 
around, O

just O 
becuase O 
they O 
still O

go O

(11pm O

I O

The O

when O

the O

serious O

the O 
biggest O 
for O 
what O 
it's O

as O

as O 
I O

concerned: O 
both O

undefeated O 
this O 
year O 
when O 
scoring O 
first. O 
Auburn ORG
is O 
8-0 O 
and O 
UGA ORG
is O 
5-0. O 
I'd O 
say O 
that's O 
the O 
biggest O 
stat O 
right O 
now. O 
Auburn's ORG
offense O 
is O 
potent O 
and O 
efficient. O 
UGA's ORG
defense O 
is O 
relentless O 
and O 
contains O 
a O 
couple O 
of O 
the O 
country's O 
biggest O 
hitters, O 
especially O 
Greg PER
Blue PER
and O 
Odell PER
Thurman. PER
Auburn's ORG
defense O 
is O 
fast O 
and O 
relentless O 
and O 
the O 
DB's O 
are O 
experienced O 
and O 
big. O 
UGA's ORG
receivers O 
are O 
leaders, O 
with O 
one O 
of O 
them O 
a O 
team O 
captain. O 
Auburn's ORG
two O 
running O 
backs O 
are O 
seniors O 
and O 
very O 
experienced O 
and O 
dangerous, O 
bruising O 
backs. O 
UGA's ORG
two O 
backs O 
are O 
smaller O 
freshmen O 
with O 
less O 
experience, O 
but O 
are O 
dangerous O 
as O 
well. O 
In O 
my O 
mind, O 
the O 
game O 
is O 
going O 
to O 
turn O 
on O 
a O 
few O 
key O 
points, O 
some O 
obvious O 
and O 
some O 
not. O 
Here O 
goes O 
the O 
prediction O 
machine: O 
- O 
Turnovers O 
(as O 
always) O 
will O 
be O 
critical. O 
- O 
Special O 
teams O 
play O 
and O 
lack O 
of O 
special O 
teams O 
mistakes O 
will O 
tell O 
the O 
tale O 
regarding O 
field O 
position. O 
- O 
Both O 
teams O 
MUST O 
establish O 
the O 
run O 
to O 
be O 
successful. O 
If O 
Auburn ORG
goes O 
for O 
150 O 
between O 
their O 
two O 
backs, O 
they're O 
almost O 
impossible O 
to O 
beat. O 
Conversely, O 
Georgia ORG
MUST O 
be O 
able O 
to O 
run O 
the O 
ball O 
to O 
set O 
up O 
play O 
action O 
and O 
keep O 
the O 
pressure O 
off O 
of O 
David PER

Mark PER

be O 
a O 
better O 
on O 
the O

coach O

Tommy PER
Tuberville. PER

famous O 
for O 
taking O 
chances, O 
often O 
unnecessary O 
ones. O 
That O 
history O 
is O 
of O 
concern O 
to O 
me. O 
While O 
it's O 
okay O 
to O 
try O 
crazy O 
shit O 
when O 
your O 
team O 
is O 
under-rated O 
or O 
a O 
serious O 
underdog, O 
it's O 
important O 
not O 
to O 
give O 
games O 
away O 
when O 
you're O 
the O 
favorite. O 
Playing O 
more O 
"by O 
the O 
book" O 
and O 
a O 
bit O 
"closer O 
to O 
the O

becomes O 
the O 
call O 
for O 
the O 
day. O 
Considering O 
all O 
of O 
these O 
factors, O 
I O 
truly O 
believe O 
that O 
this O 
is O 
Auburn's ORG
year. O 
They O 
may O 
not O 
go O 
undefeated O 
and O 
they O 
may O

they O

for O

here O

10-0 O

staring O

how O 
we O

Really? O 
You O

find O 
a O

only O 
with O 
the O

In O

10-0, O 
number O

in O

and O 
coming O 
into O 
Auburn ORG
for O 
the O 
first O 
time O 
ever O 
to O 
play O 
at O 
Jordan-Hare O

All O 
the O 
talk O 
for O 
the O 
weeks O 
leading O 
up O 
to O 
the O 
game O 
was O 
about O 
"if O 
Bama's ORG
undefeated, O 
they'll O 
play O 
for O 
it O 
all O 
in O 
the O 
Sugar O

and O 
other O

like O 
that. O 
Well, O 
"if O 
or O 
when" O 
never O 
happened O 
because O 
Auburn ORG
won O 
30-20 O 
in O 
one O

ever, O 
putting O 
an O 
end O 
to O 
Bama's ORG
national O

hopes O 
for O

15 O

the O

It's O 
Auburn ORG
that's O 
undefeated O 
and O 
facing O 
the O 
road O 
game O 
at O 
the O 
end O 
of O 
the O

Suddenly, O 
I'm O 
about O

about O 
this O 
game O

Despite O 
being O

all O

Well, O 
it's O 
mid-morning O 
on O 
the O 
East LOC
coast LOC
and O 
I O 
am O 
sitting O 
here O 
running O 
numbers O 
thru O 
my O 
head O 
trying O 
to O 
figure O 
out O 
what's O 
going O 
to O 
happen O 
in O 
the O 
Iron O 
Bowl, O 
which O 
is O 
just O 
over O 
29 O 
hours O 
away. O 
The O 
game O 
is O 
being O 
played O 
in O 
Tuscaloosa, O 
which O 
should O 
be O 
an O 
advantage O 
to O 
Alabama. ORG
However, O 
In O 
the O 
two O 
times O 
the O 
game O 
has O 
been O 
played O 
in O 
Bryant O 
Denny O 
Stadium, O 
Auburn ORG
has O 
won. O 
Alabama ORG
has O 
one O 
of O 
the O 
stingiest O 
defenses O 
in O 
the O 
country, O 
and O 
were O 
ranked O 
number O 
one O 
in O 
overall O 
defense O 
as O 
recently O 
as O 
last O 
week. O 
Conversely, O 
Auburn ORG
has O 
one O 
of O 
the O 
most O 
potent O 
and O 
balanced O 
offensive O 
attacks O 
in O 
the O 
nation. O 
Also, O 
I O 
don't O 
think O 
Bama ORG
has O 
faced O 
an O 
attack O 
with O 
two O 
great O 
runners, O 
a O 
great O 
line, O 
a O 
poised O 
QB O 
and O 
good O 
receivers O 
and O 
a O 
tight O 
end O 
as O 
well. O 
Bama ORG
is O 
missing O 
it's O 
starting O 
offensive O 
backfield O 
from O 
the O 
start O 
of O 
the O 
season. O 
The O 
fact O 
that O 
they've O 
won O 
six O 
games O 
is O 
a O 
testament O 
to O 
the O 
coaching O 
and O 
heart O 
of O 
the O 
players. O 
Alabama ORG
simply O 
cannot O 
throw O 
the O 
football, O 
which O 
is O 
a O 
good O 
thing, O 
because O 
Auburn's ORG
defensive O 
backfield O 
is O 
second O 
to O 
none. O 
Bama ORG
can O 
run O 
the O 
ball O 
however. O 
Unfortunately O 
for O 
them, O 
with O 
no O 
passing O 
game O 
to O 
keep O 
the O 
defense O 
honest, O 
Auburn ORG
will O 
probably O 
stack O 
nine O 
in O 
the O 
box, O 
play O 
man O 
on O 
the O 
corners, O 
and O 
dare O 
Bama ORG
to O 
run, O 
and O 
I O 
don't O 
think O 
they'll O 
be O 
able O 
to O 
do O 
it. O 
Auburn ORG
is O 
also O 
9-0 O 
when O 
they O 
score O 
first. O 
The O 
Tuberville PER
way O 
is O 
to O 
get O 
one O 
quick O 
and O 
early O 
to O 
get O 
your O 
crowd O 
into O 
it O 
if O 
you're O 
at O 
home O 
and O 
to O 
quiet O 
the O 
other O 
team's O 
crowd O 
if O 
you're O 
on O 
the O 
road. O 
You O 
can O 
never O 
tell O 
what O 
is O 
going O 
to O 
happen O 
in O 
rivalry O 
games. O 
In O 
this O 
exact O 
game O 
15 O 
years O 
ago, O 
Bama ORG
came O 
into O 
Auburn O 
#2 O 
in O 
the O 
country, O 
undefeated O 
at O 
10-0 O 
and O 
looking O 
for O 
yet O 
another O 
national O 
championship. O 
They O 
were O 
summarily O 
trounced O 
30-20 O 
in O 
a O 
game O 
in O 
which O 
the O 
score O 
was O 
closer O 
than O 
the O 
actual O 
game. O 
That O 
could O 
very O 
well O 
happen O 
Saturday. O 
I O 
always O 
tell O 
people O 
that O 
the O 
Georgia ORG
game O 
matters O 
more O 
to O 
me O 
than O 
the O 
Bama ORG
game. O 
I O 
live O 
in O 
Georgia, O 
and O 
losing O 
that O 
game O 
affects O 
me O 
much O 
more O 
directly O 
than O 
losing O 
the O 
Alabama ORG
game. O 
That O 
said, O 
when O

time O 
comes, O 
you O 
remember O 
all O

and O 
"Bear O

and O 
everything O

that O 
goes O

(cough...cough...sarcasm...cough). O 
Never O

if O 
the O

where O 
the O

Anyone? O 
The O 
fact O 
that O 
these O

(Sheff, PER

I O

that O 
Barry PER

Whether O

HGH, O

lighter O

this O 
length O

That's O 
why O 
it's O 
a O

that, O 
in O 
the O

all O 
of O

numbers O

going O 
to O

ignored O 
and O 
lumped O 
into O 
the O

"yeah, O 
but O 
he O 
was O

It's O 
a O

he O

here's O 
a O 
great O

I O 
read O 
today: O 
A O 
man O 
takes O 
his O 
Rottweiler O 
to O 
the O 
vet O 
and O 
says, O 
"My O 
dog's O 
cross-eyed, O 
is O 
there O 
anything O 
you O 
can O 
do O 
for O 
him? O 
" O 
"Well," O 
says O 
the O 
vet, O 
"let's O 
have O 
a O 
look O 
at O 
him." O 
So O 
he O 
picks O 
the O 
dog O 
up O 
and O 
examines O 
his O 
eyes, O 
then O 
checks O 
his O 
teeth. O 
Finally, O 
the O 
vet O 
says O 
"I'm O 
going O 
to O 
have O 
to O 
put O 
him O 
down." O 
"What? O 
Because O 
he's O 
cross-eyed?" O 
"No, O 
because O 
he's O 
really O 
heavy." O 
I O 
will O 
be O 
breaking O 
down O 
the O 
SEC ORG
championship O 
game O 
either O 
later O 
today O 
or O 
tomorrow, O 
so O 
I O 
expect O 
you O 
all O 
to O 
be O 
planted O 
firmly O 
on O 
the O 
edge O

First O 
of O

I O 
want O 
to O 
congratulate O 
the O 
Auburn ORG
Football O 
team O 
for O 
doing O 
what O 
no O 
other O 
Auburn ORG
football O 
team O 
has O 
done; O 
going O 
12-0. O 
They O 
also O 
won O 
their O 
first O 
outright O 
SEC ORG
title O 
since O 
1987 O 
and O 
won O 
their O 
first O 
SEC ORG
title O 
since O 
the O 
conference O 
implimented O 
the O 
Championship O

format. O 
A O 
year O 
ago, O 
the O 
program O 
was O 
in O 
disarray O 
and O 
the O 
coach O 
was O 
one O 
poorly O 
executed O 
plane O 
trip O 
away O 
from O 
being O 
fired O 
by O 
an O 
over-zealous O 
and O 
too O 
empowered O 
booster O 
with O 
a O 
fat O 
checkbook. O 
Since O 
that O 
day, O 
the O 
team O 
is O 
undefeated O 
and O 
has O 
won O 
14 O 
games O 
in O 
a O 
row. O 
They O 
have O 
now O 
beated O 
four O 
teams O 
that O 
were O 
in O 
the O 
top O 
15 O 
at O 
the O 
time O 
the O 
games O 
were O 
played, O 
and O 
two O 
of O 
those O 
games O 
were O 
won O 
away O 
from O 
Jordan-Hare O 
Stadium. O 
On O 
championship O 
weekend, O 
the O 
big O 
three O 
all O 
played. O 
USC ORG
won O 
by O 
five O 
over O 
a O 
shitty O 
UCLA ORG
team O 
with O 
a O 
6-5 O 
record, O 
and O 
that O 
was O 
thanks O 
in O 
part O 
to O 
an O 
official O 
who O 
blew O 
dead O 
a O 
clear O 
and O 
obvious O 
fumble O 
that O 
would O 
have O 
been O 
returned O 
for O 
a O 
UCLA ORG
touchdown. O 
Oklahoma ORG
played O 
in O 
it's O 
conference O 
title O 
game O 
against O 
a O 
four-loss O 
Colorado ORG
team O 
that O 
can't O 
throw O 
the O 
ball. O 
The O 
result O 
was O 
a O 
40 O 
plus O 
point O 
beatdown, O 
but O 
what O 
did O 
anyone O 
expect? O 
Auburn ORG
played O 
15th O 
ranked O 
Tennessee ORG
and O 
was O 
attempting O 
to O 
do O 
one O 
of O 
the O 
toughest O 
things O 
to O 
do O 
in O 
college O 
football: O 
beating O 
a O 
team O 
twice O 
in O 
the O 
same O 
year. O 
With O 
the O 
exception O 
of O 
a O 
15 O 
yard O 
shanked O 
punt O 
and O 
a O 
punt O 
snap O 
that O 
Kody PER
Bliss PER
missed O 
while O 
having O 
an O 
apparent O 
thrombosis, O 
Auburn ORG
led O 
21-7 O 
at O 
the O 
half O 
and O 
had O 
held O 
UT ORG
to O 
46 O 
yards O 
of O 
offense. O 
While O 
the O 
Auburn ORG
running O 
game O 
was O 
held O 
up, O 
Jason PER
Campbell PER
threw O 
it O 
all O 
over O 
the O 
ball O 
field O 
and, O 
when O 
his O 
receivers O 
were O 
covered, O 
he O 
ran O 
for O 
yardage O 
on O 
his O 
own. O 
This O 
despite O 
several O 
late O 
hits O 
to O 
the O 
head, O 
low O 
hits O 
at O 
his O 
knees O 
and O 
ankles, O 
and O 
various O 
other O 
assaults O 
outside O 
the O 
realm O 
of O 
good O 
sportsmanship. O 
Tennessee ORG
scored O 
on O 
a O 
pass O 
play O 
that O 
was O 
incorrectly O 
ruled O 
a O 
touchdown, O 
since O 
the O 
ball O 
clearly O 
touched O 
the O 
turf, O 
and O 
that's O 
where O 
the O 
momentum O 
of O 
the O 
game O 
changed. O 
I O 
think O 
it O 
was O 
also O 
at O 
that O 
point O 
that O 
the O 
scoreboard O 
began O 
to O 
reflect O 
Auburn's ORG
last O 
title O 
hopes O 
dying O 
as O 
the O 
Oklahoma-Colorado ORG
score ORG
would O 
have O 
begun O 
showing O 
the O 
beat-down O 
that O 
was O 
occuring. O 
Auburn ORG
was O 
tied O 
21-21 O 
and O 
in O 
jeapordy O 
of O 
losing O 
it O 
most O 
important O 
game O 
ever, O 
but O 
senior O 
QB O 
Jason PER
Campbell PER
would O 
have O 
none O 
of O 
it. O 
Auburn ORG
won O 
going O 
away O 
38-28, O 
and O 
the O 
only O 
place O 
the O 
game O 
looked O 
close O 
was O 
on O 
the O

I O 
can't O 
believe O 
that O 
an O 
undefeated O 
SEC ORG

is O 
not O 
playing O 
for O 
a O

but O 
I O 
guess O 
we O 
can O 
thank O 
Jeff PER

the O

one O

make O 
up O 
for O 
what O 
happened O 
to O 
them O 
last O

All O 
I O 
know O 
is O 
that O 
they O 
better O 
think O 
that O 
way O 
next O 
year, O 
because O 
it's O 
Auburn ORG
that O 
got O 
screwed O 
this O 
year. O 
And O 
what's O 
better O 
is O 
that O 
Auburn ORG
gets O 
to O 
play O 
one O 
of O 
the O 
three O 
hottest O 
teams O 
in O 
the O 
country O 
in O 
my O 
opinion. O 
Virginia ORG

talented, O 
very O 
athletic O

one O

the O 
most O 
well O

in O 
the O 
country O 
and O 
they O 
WILL O 
come O 
to O 
play O 
on O 
January O 
3rd. O 
I O 
hope O 
our O 
kids O 
can O 
shake O 
off O 
this O 
travesty O 
and O 
focus O 
on O 
making O 
the O 
pollsters O 
look O 
like O 
idiots. O 
Maybe O 
an O 
Oklahoma ORG
win O 
in O 
a O 
butt-ugly O 
game O 
and O 
a O 
great O 
Auburn ORG
performance O 
could O 
help. O 
What's O

Sorry O

a O 
funny O

today O

thought O 
I'd O 
share O

One O 
of O 
my O 
fellow O

posted O 
it, O 
so O 
Chet, PER
here's O 
your O 
credit: O 
A O 
traveler O 
was O 
driving O 
through O 
Arkansas O 
when O 
he O 
lost O 
his O 
way O 
and O 
got O 
off O 
the O 
main O 
highway. O 
As O 
he O 
drove O 
by, O 
he O 
saw O 
rows O 
and O 
rows O 
of O 
pigsties O 
and O 
pigpens O 
and O 
pigs O 
running O 
in O 
fields O 
and O 
pigs O 
wallowing O 
in O 
mud. O 
Suddenly, O 
his O 
eye O 
caught O 
something O 
really O 
strange. O 
He O 
did O 
a O 
double O 
take, O 
muttered O 
to O 
himself O 
and O 
then O 
looked O 
a O 
third O 
time. O 
He O 
wondered O 
if O 
he O 
had O 
seen O 
correctly O 
- O 
it O 
looked O 
like O 
a O 
pig O 
with O 
a O 
wooden O 
leg! O 
He O 
found O 
the O 
lane O 
to O 
the O 
farm O 
and O 
drove O 
up O 
into O 
the O 
farmyard, O 
where O 
he O 
was O 
met O 
by O 
the O 
farmer. O 
"Excuse O 
me," O 
the O 
traveler O 
said. O 
"I O 
was O 
just O 
driving O 
by O 
and O 
looking O 
at O 
all O 
your O 
pigs, O 
and O 
I O 
noticed O 
something O 
that O 
I O 
just O 
had O 
to O 
stop O 
and O 
ask O 
about. O 
Tell O 
me, O 
did O 
I O 
see O 
right? O 
Is O 
there O 
really O 
a O 
pig O 
out O 
there O 
with O 
a O 
wooden O 
leg?" O 
The O 
farmer O 
smiled. O 
"Oh, O 
that O 
would O 
be O 
old O 
Caesar O 
you O 
saw. O 
He's O 
the O 
finest O 
pig O 
a O 
man O 
could O 
ever O 
hope O 
to O 
have O 
- O 
and O 
smart! O 
Well, O 
let O 
me O 
tell O 
you O 
a O 
little O 
about O 
that O 
pig. O 
You O 
see O 
that O 
barge O 
down O 
there O 
on O 
the O 
river? O 
That's O 
a O 
mining O 
dredge, O 
taking O 
out O 
platinum O 
ore. O 
Old O 
Caesar O 
sniffed O 
out O 
the O 
vein O 
and O 
showed O 
us O 
how O 
to O 
set O 
it O 
up. O 
Now O 
that O 
dredge O 
brings O 
me O 
in O 
about O 
$120,000 O 
every O 
year. O 
"There's O 
another O 
thing, O 
too, O 
a O 
little O 
more O 
personal. O 
One O 
night O 
a O 
couple O 
of O 
years O 
ago O 
I O 
got O 
to O 
drinking O 
and O 
I O 
guess O 
I O 
had O 
more O 
than O 
I O 
should O 
have. O 
I O 
passed O 
out O 
drunk, O 
fell O 
down O 
and O 
knocked O 
over O 
a O 
lamp. O 
That O 
started O 
a O 
fire O 
in O 
the O 
house O 
and O 
old O 
Caesar O 
smelled O 
the O 
smoke. O 
He O 
came O 
in O 
the O 
back O 
door, O 
got O 
the O 
wife O 
and O 
kid O 
out, O 
roused O 
me O 
up O 
and O 
got O 
me O 
out. O 
"There O 
is O 
no O 
question O 
about O 
it O 
- O 
that O 
night O 
old O 
Caesar O 
saved O 
all O 
our O 
lives O 
and O 
you O 
know O 
that O 
is O 
not O 
the O 
sort O 
of O 
thing O 
a O 
man O 
is O 
going O 
to O 
forget O 
too O 
easily." O 
"Why," O 
the O 
traveler O 
said, O 
"this O 
is O 
all O 
amazing! O 
I O 
have O 
never O 
heard O 
of O 
a O 
pig O 
like O 
this O 
before! O 
This O 
is O 
fantastic! O 
But O 
tell O 
me, O 
how O 
did O 
he O 
get O 
that O 
wooden O 
leg? O 
Was O 
he O 
in O 
a O 
wreck O 
or O 
something?" O 
The O 
farmer O 
laughed O 
and O 
said, O 
"Well, O 
naturally, O 
when O 
you O 
have O 
a O 
pig O 
that O 
smart, O 
you O 
don't O 
want O

eat O 
him O 
all O

days O 
and O 
weeks O

come. O 
With O 
4:41 O 
left O 
in O 
the O 
fourth O 
quarter O 
and O 
the O 
Packers ORG
down O 
by O 
11, O 
Favre PER
hit O 
Robert PER
Ferguson PER
with O 
a O 
31 O 
yard O 
strike O 
near O 
the O 
left O 
hash O 
marks. O 
Coming O 
from O 
the O 
other O 
direction, O 
Jacksonville ORG
DB O 
Donovin PER
Darius PER
unloaded O 
chin O 
high O 
on O 
Ferguson PER
with O 
a O 
vicious O 
clothesline. O 
Remarkably, O 
Ferguson PER
held O 
on O 
to O 
the O 
ball, O 
despite O 
being O 
disjoined O 
from O 
his O 
helmet O 
on O 
the O 
hit. O 
After O 
many O 
minutes O 
lying O 
motionless O 
on O 
the O 
field, O 
Ferguson PER
was O 
finally O 
removed O 
via O 
stretcher, O 
giving O 
a O 
thumbs O 
up O 
to O 
the O 
crowd O 
on O 
the O 
way O 
out. O 
The O 
Packers ORG
went O 
on O 
to O 
lose O 
the O 
game, O 
but O 
that's O 
not O 
the O 
story O 
here. O 
This O 
was O 
not O 
one O 
of O 
the O 
staged O 
stiff-armed O 
clotheslines O 
you O 
see O 
in O 
professional O 
wrestling O 
broadcasts. O 
This O 
was O 
a O 
vicious, O 
arm O 
cocked O 
and O 
swinging O 
clothesline O 
that O 
literally O 
could O 
have O 
torn O 
Ferguson's PER
head O 
off O 
of O 
his O 
body. O 
The O 
play O 
was O 
immediately O 
flagged, O 
and O 
moments O 
later O 
it O 
was O 
announced O 
that O 
Darius PER
had O 
been O 
ejected, O 
much O 
to O 
the O 
crowd's O 
delight. O 
One O 
sidenote O 
here O 
is O 
that, O 
despite O 
their O 
rabid O 
fandom O 
and O 
the O 
situation, O 
not O 
one O 
thing O 
was O 
thrown O 
at O 
the O 
offending O 
player O 
as O 
he O 
left O 
the O 
field. O 
It O 
would O 
have O 
been O 
easy O 
to O 
bathe O 
him O 
in O 
beer O 
or O 
snowballs O 
or O 
batteries O 
as O 
he O 
left, O 
but O 
the O 
Packer ORG
fans O 
are O 
classier O 
than O 
that. O 
To O 
a O 
person, O 
they O 
acted O 
with O 
class, O 
using O 
their O 
voices O 
and O 
not O 
projectiles O 
to O 
express O 
their O 
displeasure. O 
This O 
was O 
the O 
most O 
vicious O 
and O 
blatantly O 
dirty O 
play O 
I O 
have O 
seen O 
in O 
the O 
NFL ORG
since O 
Jim PER
McMahon PER
was O 
body O 
slammed O 
to O 
the O 
ground O 
in O 
the O 
mid O 
80's O 
about O 
five O 
seconds O 
after O 
he O 
had O 
released O 
a O 
pass. O 
And O 
Jaguars ORG
coach O 
Jack PER
Del PER

Darius PER
had O 
the O 
nerve O 
to O 
vociferously O 
argue O 
with O 
officials O 
about O 
Darius' PER
ejection O 
from O 
the O

I O 
don't O 
care O 
what O 
anyone O 
says O 
about O 
"you O 
can't O 
judge O 
intent." O 
Darius' PER
intent O 
was O 
to O 
dismember, O 
injure O 
or O 
even O 
kill O 
Ferguson. PER
The O 
more O 
I O 
saw O 
the O 
replay, O 
the O 
sicker O 
it O 
made O

feel. O 
The O

it O

sure. O 
I'm O 
talking O 
about O 
a O 
four O

that O 
included O

if O 
necessary. O 
In O 
this O

age O 
of O 
bigger, O 
stronger O 
and O 
faster O 
players, O 
injuries O 
are O 
going O 
to O 
happen O 
accidentally O 
all O 
of O 
the O 
time. O 
There O 
is O 
simply O 
no O 
room O 
for O 
the O 
kind O 
of O 
play O 
that O 
resulted O 
in O 
Ferguson's PER
injury. O 
Paul PER
Tagliabue PER
must O 
give O 
word O 
to O 
all O 
of O 
his O 
employees O 
that O 
actions O 
like O 
this O

not O

tolerated. O 
Maybe O 
that O

tell O 
the O

Darius PER

players O

that O 
this O 
kind O 
of O 
head-hunting O 
will O 
not O

tolerated O

If O 
not, O 
I O 
fully O 
expect O 
the O

many O 
other O 
teams O 
to O 
handle O 
this O

The O 
college O 
football O 
season O 
is O 
finally O 
over. O 
On O 
one O 
hand, O 
I O 
am O 
a O 
bit O 
sad O 
because O 
years O 
like O 
this O 
only O 
happen O 
for O 
Auburn ORG
every O 
15 O 
or O 
20 O 
years, O 
so O 
it's O 
a O 
little O 
disappointing. O 
On O 
the O 
other O 
hand, O 
this O 
worked O 
out O 
about O 
as O 
well O 
as O 
it O 
could. O 
If O 
you O 
asked O 
me O 
at O 
the O 
beginning O 
of O 
the O 
year O 
if O 
I'd O 
rather O 
be O 
8-3 O 
and O 
playing O 
in O 
the O 
liberty O 
bowl O 
or O 
12-0 O 
with O 
a O 
chance O 
to O 
win O 
the O 
Sugar O 
Bowl, O 
go O 
13-0 O 
and O 
finish O 
second, O 
I'd O 
say O 
hell O 
yeah O 
to O 
the O 
latter. O 
The O 
fact O 
that O 
pundits O 
put O 
OU ORG
ahead O 
of O 
Auburn ORG
based O 
on O 
their O 
out O 
of O 
conference O

being O 
tougher O 
than O

is O 
laughable O 
now. O 
In O 
the O 
end, O 
playing O 
Bowling ORG
Green ORG
over O 
us O 
playing O 
The ORG
Citadel ORG
didn't O 
make O 
the O 
Sooners ORG
much O 
better. O 
Man, O 
I've O 
seen O 
softer O 
takedowns O 
on O 
Cops. O 
USC ORG
came O 
on O 
to O 
the O 
field, O 
gave O 
up O 
a O

then O 
decided O 
to O 
make O 
Choke-lahoma ORG
their O 
collective O 
bitches, O 
and O 
they O 
did O 
just O 
that. O 
38-10 O 
at O 
the O

Our O

have O 
had O 
something O 
to O 
say O 
about O

And, O 
it O 
turns O 
out O 
that O 
when O 
playing O 
a O 
decent O 
team, O 
OU ORG
can't O 
do O 
shit O 
on O

That O 
was O 
just O

four O

lost O

must O 
feel O 
like O 
being O 
a O

fan O 
before O 
this O 
year, O 
I'd O 
imagine. O 
Anyway, O 
I O 
feel O 
great. O 
Think O 
about O 
this. O 
A O 
year O 
ago, O 
Tuberville PER
was O 
one O 
reporter's O 
abililty O 
to O 
find O 
an O 
out O 
of O 
place O 
airplane O 
in O 
Ohio O 
away O 
from O 
being O 
fired O 
BEFORE O 
the O 
Alabama ORG
game. O 
Then, O 
the O 
AD O 
and O 
President O 
get O 
canned, O 
a O 
booster O 
starts O 
down O 
the O 
long O 
road O 
to O 
shun-ville, O 
and O 
Tuberville PER
keeps O 
smiling O 
and O 
saying O 
the O 
right O 
things. O 
He O 
talks O 
his O 
two O 
running O 
backs O 
and O 
two O 
stellar O 
DB's O 
into O 
staying, O 
then O 
knocks O 
out O 
15 O 
straight O 
wins O 
and O 
signs O 
one O 
of O 
those O 
super O 
iron-clad O 
contracts O 
that O 
will O 
pay O 
him O 
14 O 
million O 
over O 
seven O 
years, O 
and O 
if O 
Auburn ORG
even O 
thinks...THINKS O 
about O 
letting O 
him O 
go, O 
they O 
owe O 
him O 
every O 
penny. O 
I O 
don't O 
even O 
think O 
there's O 
a O 
morality O 
clause. O 
He O 
could O 
have O 
sex O 
with O 
an O 
endangered O 
Bald O 
Eagle, O 
and O 
they'd O 
STILL O 
have O 
to O 
pay O 
him. O 
And O 
that's O 
the O 
way O 
it O 
should O 
be. O 
Meanwhile, O 
Auburn ORG
fans O 
can O 
spend O 
the O 
next O 
six O 
months O 
saying O 
"yeah, O 
but O 
we'd O 
have O 
done O 
this" O 
or O 
"We O 
were O 
13-0, O 
won O 
the O 
sec, O 
beat O 
five O 
top O 
ten O 
teams, O 
three O 
of O 
them O 
on O 
the O 
road, O 
and O 
became O 
the O 
only O 
undefeated O 
SEC ORG
team O 
in O 
the O 
BCS's ORG
history O 
to O 
NOT O 
play O 
for O 
the O 
title." O 
And O 
coincidentally, O 
Oklahoma's ORG
played O 
in O 
it O 
this O 
year, O 
last O 
year, O 
and O 
in O 
2000. O 
You O 
won O 
in O 
2000, O 
but O 
you O 
got O 
punked O 
the O 
last O 
two O 
years, O 
and O 
last O 
year O 
you O 
got O 
to O 
play O 
for O 
the O 
title O 
even O 
though O 
you O 
didn't O 
even O 
win O 
your O 
conference. O 
You O 
got O 
embarassed O 
by O 
Kansas ORG
State ORG
and O 
LSU ORG
last O 
year, O 
and O 
humiliated O 
this O 
year. O 
But O 
the O 
little ORG
12 ORG
is O 
SOOO O 
much O 
better O 
than O 
the O 
SEC. ORG
That's O 
why O 
you O 
played O 
a O 
four-loss O 
team O 
for O 
your O 
conference O 
title O 
this O 
year. O 
And, O 
considering O 
the O 
BCS ORG
is O 
run O 
by O 
the O 
head O 
of O 
the O 
Big ORG
12, ORG
it's O 
no O 
wonder O 
you O 
get O 
the O 
benefit O 
of O 
the O 
doubt. O 
Don't O 
think O 
so? O 
How O 
about O 
the O 
fact O 
that O 
only O 
two O 
teams O 
that O 
didn't O 
win O 
their O 
conference O 
have O 
ever O 
played O 
for O 
the O 
national O 
title? O 
You O 
and O 
Nebraska ORG
in O 
2001. O 
Oh, O 
the O 
other O 
thing O 
you O 
two O 
Big O 
12 O 
teams O 
have O 
in O 
common O 
is O 
that O 
you O 
got O 
your O 
asses O 
kicked O 
on O 
the O 
sport's O 
biggest O 
stage. O 
So O 
yes, O 
we O 
are O 
disappointed. O 
But O 
all O 
you O 
can O 
do O 
is O 
play O 
the O

in O 
front O 
of O 
you. O 
Auburn ORG

the O 
fact O

that O

Anyone O

counter O 
that O

would O

start O 
by O 
taking O 
us O 
back O 
to O 
1997, O 
when O 
in O 
terms O 
of O 
time O 
used, O 
text O 
was O 
the O 
most O 
popular O 
kind O 
of O 
information O 
online. O 
At O 
the O 
time, O 
and O 
for O 
years O 
after, O 
people O 
argued O 
that O 
the O 
traditional O 
bookstore O 
would O 
become O 
obsolete. O 
After O 
all, O 
how O 
could O 
we O 
stand O 
for O 
a O 
rapaciously O 
arborcidal O 
medium O 
like O 
'books' O 
or O 
'newspapers' O 
when O 
we O 
could O 
transmit O 
the O 
same O 
data O 
as O 
bits O 
and O 
bytes O 
and O 
save O 
on O 
transportation, O 
too? O 
As O 
it O 
turns O 
out, O 
of O 
course, O 
Amazon.com, ORG
BarnseandNoble.com, ORG
and O 
a O 
host O 
of O 
others O 
simply O 
took O 
the O 
bookstore O

attached O

Who O 
d'you O 
think O 
you're O 
kidding? O 
You O 
can't O 
kill O 
movie O 
rental O 
stores O 
-- O 
So O 
there's O 
a O 
big O 
difference O 
between O 
movies O 
and O 
books: O 
For O 
books, O 
the O 
retail O 
store O 
is O 
practically O 
the O 
sole O 
medium O 
of O 
distribution; O 
if O 
you O 
don't O 
sell O 
through O 
them, O 
books O 
won't O 
get O 
sold. O 
For O 
movies, O 
the O 
video O 
rental O 
store O 
is O 
just O 
one O 
way O 
to O 
get O 
videos O 
out O 
there O 
(though O 
at O 
45-55% O 
of O 
studio O 
revenues, O 
it's O 
a O 
much O 
more O 
important O 
one O 
than O 
people O 
think). O 
But O 
given O 
the O 
high O 
valuations O 
ascribed O 
to O 
bricks-and-mortar-and-dead O 
tree O 
booksellers O 
like O 
Barnes ORG
and ORG
Noble ORG
, O 
Borders ORG
, O 
and O 
to O 
a O 
much O 
lesser O 
extent O 
Books-A-Million ORG
, O 
surely O 
there's O 
room O 
for O 
a O 
Blockbuster ORG
, O 
along O 
with O 
a O 
Movie ORG
Gallery ORG
or O 
two. O 
The O 
latter, O 
at O 
least, O 
still O 
has O 
room O 
to O 
grow. O 
By O 
focusing O 
on O 
smaller, O 
rural O 
communities O 
(preferably O 
the O 
sort O 
that O 
considers O 
DSL O 
'newfangled') O 
they're O 
WalMarting O 
WalMart ORG
-- O 
competing O 
with O 
Walmart's ORG
awful O 
in-store O 
video O 
rentals O 
by O 
offering O 
better O 
selection O 
and O 
much O 
lower O 
prices. O 
The O 
movie O 
business O 
is O 
changing O 
dramatically O 
as O 
the O 
potential O 
for O 
online O 
distribution O 
grows, O 
but O 
like O 
every O 
other O 
business O 
it O 
leaves O 
lots O 
of O 
room O 
for O 
traditional O 
operators O 
to O 
operate O 
at O 
traditional O 
(read: O 
high) O 
profits. O

Conglomerating? O 
Byrne PER
2004-12-12T14:47:00 O 
Conglomerates O 
are O 
a O 
fascinating O 
species: O 
The O

definition O 
is O 
'a O

involved O 
in O 
multiple O 
unrelated O 
businesses' O 
but O 
the O 
more O 
accurate O 
definition O 
would O 
be O 
'a O 
company O 
that O 
relies O 
on O 
financial O 
pyrotechnics, O 
balance O 
sheet O 
juggling, O 
and O 
adroit O 
accounting O 
to O 
create O 
the O 
illusion O 
of O

I O 
love O 
to O 
write O 
about O 
them, O 
but O 
I'd O 
hate O 
to O 
own O 
one, O 
since O 
most O 
of O 
their O 
market O 
value O 
comes O 
from O 
the O 
market's O 
assumption O 
that O 
the O 
company's O 
leaders O 
will O 
somehow O 
find O 
a O 
way O 
to O 
retroactively O 
justify O 
their O 
overvaluation. O 
Usually, O 
it O 
doesn't O 
work, O 
but O 
when O 
it O 
does O 
the O 
results O 
can O 
be O 
spectacularly O 
entertaining. O 
For O 
a O 
while O

The O 
recent O 
rumors O 
about O 
WalMart's ORG
plans O 
to O 
buy O 
out O 
a O 
shipping O 
company O 
have O 
given O 
rise O 
to O 
the O 
fear O 
that O 
the O 
company O 
may O 
go O 
the O 
conglomerate O 
route. O 
They O 
have O 
many O 
of O 
the O 
symptoms O 
of O 
a O 
late-stage O 
conglomerate: O 
A O 
gigantic O 
main O 
business O 
with O 
slowing O 
growth, O 
fear O 
that O 
competition O 
will O 
substantially O 
reduce O 
the O 
profitability O 
of O 
their O 
main O 
business, O 
a O 
shareholder O 
base O 
that O 
includes O 
many O 
people O 
who O 
own O 
only O 
WalMart ORG
stock O 
(thus O 
providing O 
another O 
incentive O 
for O 
intracompany O 
diversification), O 
and O 
enough O 
resources O 
to O 
pull O 
it O 
off O 
on O 
a O 
grand O 
scale. O 
I O 
can O 
understand O 
the O 
concerns, O 
but O 
I O 
don't O 
see O 
the O 
motivation. O 
As O 
a O 
retailer O 
of O 
just O 
about O 
everything, O 
WalMart ORG
can O 
expand O 
into O 
some O 
pretty O 
broadly-defined O 
areas O 
without O 
going O 
beyond O 
either O 
their O 
core O 
competencies O 
or O 
some O 
arenas O 
where O 
they O 
can O 
cut O 
costs. O 
After O 
all, O 
adding O 
some O 
international O 
shipping O 
assets O 
to O 
their O 
holdings O 
would O 
be O 
a O 
natural O

of O

we've O 
something O 
very O 
much O 
like O 
it: O 
A O 
company O

would O 
have O 
been O 
unthinkable O 
even O

accusations O

proof O 
of O 
some O 
less-than-Kosher O 
accounting, O 
and, O 
best O 
of O 
all, O 
allegations O 
of O 
egregious O 
self-dealing O 
by O

A O 
glance O 
at O 
the O

shows O 
that O 
they O 
have O 
a O 
lone O 
bull O 
cheerleading O 
the O 
stock, O 
and O 
plenty O 
of O 
bears O 
hammering O 
it. O 
That's O 
evidence O 
enough O 
that O 
it's O 
underpriced; O 
the O 
market O 
usually O 
reacts O 
to O 
a O 
downgrade O 
by O 
dropping O 
the O 
stock O 
a O 
percent O 
or O 
two, O 
but O 
I O 
can't O 
help O 
it O 
-- O 
I O 
presume O 
most O 
of O 
these O 
downgrades O 
arose O 
from O 
the O 
classic O 
"Well, O 
what O

"He O 
says O

"Well, O

conversation. O 
Nobody O

The O 
worst? O 
Well, O 
they're O 
still O

the O 
rest. O 
And O 
anyway, O 
I O 
don't O 
consider O 
analysts O 
anything O 
but O 
aggregators O 
of O 
publically-available O 
information O 
and O 
echo-chambers O 
for O 
previously-determined O 
opinions. O 
They O 
can't O 
really O 
add O 
much O 
without O 
straying O 
into O 
the O 
realm O 
of O 
inside O 
information, O 
and O 
what O 
they O 
do O 
add O 
is O 
usually O 
factored O 
in O 
the O

the O

Or, O

The O 
"Twin O 
Deficits" O 
Myth O 
Byrne PER
2005-02-04T13:37:00 O 
According O 
to O 
the O 
usually O 
reliable O 
CNN/Money, ORG
the O 
"Twin O 
Deficits" O 
will O 
continue O 
to O 
grow O 
. O 
Interesting O 
terminology... O 
I O 
believe O 
they're O 
referring O 
to O 
the O 
budget O 
deficit O 
and... O 
the O 
capital O 
surplus? O 
When O 
analyzing O 
trade O 
deficits, O 
it's O 
important O 
to O 
realize O 
that O 
the O 
amount O 
by O 
which O 
imports O 
exceed O 
exports O 
is O 
also O 
equal O 
to O 
the O 
net O 
amount O 
foreign O 
investors O 
have O 
bet O 
on O 
the O 
US. O 
So O 
the O 
trade O 
deficit O 
is O 
due O 
to O 
a O 
confluence O 
of O 
the O 
pressures O 
from O 
US O 
consumers O 
(who O 
control O 
about O 
20% O 
of O 
global O 
GDP) O 
and O 
everybody O 
else O 
(excluding O 
the O 
non-consumption O 
share O 
of O 
US O 
GDP, O 
that O 
would O 
amount O 
to O 
around O 
75% O 
of O 
global O 
GDP). O 
Which O 
of O 
those O 
is O 
-- O 
probably O 
-- O 
going O 
to O 
be O 
a O 
more O 
important O 
number? O 
Even O 
if O 
we O 
are O 
consumers O 
bent O 
on O 
gorging O 
ourselves O 
with O 
imported O 
goods, O 
the O 
largest O 
pressure O 
on O 
the O 
deficit O 
is O 
that O 
we're O 
simply O 
a O 
better O 
place O 
for O 
investment O 
-- O 
higher O 
returns O 
on O 
capital O 
in O 
developing O 
countries O 
are O 
more O 
than O 
mitigated O 
by O 
the O 
higher O 
political O 
risks O 
they O 
face. O 
And O 
what O 
about O 
that O 
other O 
deficit? O 
It, O 
of O 
course, O 
is O 
the O 
ominous O 
sum O 
that O 
we O 
fund O 
without O 
taxes, O 
but O 
by O 
borrowing O 
funds. O 
And O 
about O 
half O 
of O 
those O 
borrowings O 
end O 
up O 
with O 
the O 
major O 
banks O 
in O 
Asia. O 
So, O 
not O 
to O 
be O 
a O 
heretic, O 
but O 
1) O 
We're O 
issuing O 
them O 
at O 
relatively O 
low O 
interest O 
rates, O 
2) O 
Inflation O 
is O 
bound O 
to O 
pick O 
up O 
eventually, O 
and O 
so O 
3) O 
Wouldn't O 
you O 
rather O 
have O 
our O 
deficits O 
made O 
up O 
by O 
economically O 
nonsensical O 
purchases O 
by O 
non-US O 
investors, O 
rather O 
than O 
raising O 
taxes O 
in O 
America? O 
It's O 
a O 
question O 
of O 
who O 
will O 
pay O 
for O 
the O 
same O 
spending, O 
and O 
all O 
else O 
being O 
equal O 
I'd O 
be O 
happy O 
for O 
Asian O 
central O 
banks O 
to O 
pick O 
up O 
the O 
tab. O 
The O 
Twin O 
Deficits O 
are O 
a O 
reality, O 
but O 
they O 
aren't O 
exactly O 
a O 
terrifying O 
one. O

On O

the O

Good O

impose O 
pretty O 
high O 
penalties O

states, O

are O 
ill O

What's O 
notable O 
in O 
this O

however, O 
is O 
that O 
according O 
to O 
MSN ORG
Moneycentral ORG
, O 
tobacco O 
executives O 
are O 
attacking O 
the O 
tax O 
by O 
noting O 
that O 
"While O 
North O 
Carolina's O 
excise O 
tax O 
is O 
only O 
5 O 
cents, O 
the O 
total O 
taxes O 
given O 
to O 
North O

by O

adds O 
up O 
to O 
more O 
than O 
61 O 
cents O 
per O 
pack." O 
Okay, O 
okay O 
-- O 
since O 
the O 
tobacco O 
companies O 
pay O 
lots O 
of O 
money O 
to O 
the O 
states, O 
that's O 
technically O 
accurate. O 
But O 
the O 
point O 
of O 
these O 
taxes O 
is O 
to O 
align O 
the O 
price O 
of O 
a O 
pack O 
with O 
the O 
cost O 
to O 
society, O 
and O 
inasmuch O 
as O 
these O 
penalties O 
aren't O 
assessed O 
on O 
a O 
per-pack O

they O 
don't O

they're O 
a O 
lump-sum O 
reflection O 
of O 
the O

these O

Interestingly, O 
the O 
policy O

making O 
cigarette O 
buyers O 
pay O 
to O 
compensate O 
society O 
for O 
the O 
costs O

a O

the O

The O 
CEO O

board O 
...end O 
lesson. O 
I O 
guess O 
it O 
is O 
not O 
as O 
straight O 
forward O 
when O 
your O 
CEO O 
is O 
also O 
chairman O 
and O 
one O 
of O 
the O 
largest O 
shareholders. O 
It O 
would O 
be O 
tempting O 
to O 
get O 
on O 
my O 
high O 
horse O 
right O 
now O 
about O 
the O 
need O 
to O 
separate O 
the O 
positions O 
of O 
CEO O 
and O 
Chairman O 
but O 
to O 
be O 
honest O 
with O 
you O 
I O 
don't O 
really O 
believe O 
that. O 
I O 
know O 
CEO/chair O 
duality O 
is O 
a O 
popular O 
cause O 
for O 
corporate O 
governance. O 
However O 
there O 
is O 
little O 
empirical O 
evidence O 
to O 
suggest O 
that O 
separating O 
these O 
roles O 
affects O 
firm O 
performance O 
in O 
either O 
a O 
positive O 
or O 
negative O 
way. O 
Having O 
a O 
combined O 
CEO/Chairman O 
does O 
reduce O 
the O 
ability O 
of O 
the O 
board O 
to O 
act O 
as O 
a O 
check O 
on O 
management O 
and O 
this O 
does O 
mean O 
that O 
you O 
need O 
to O 
be O 
more O 
critical O 
in O 
your O 
assessment O 
of O 
the O 
trustworthiness O 
of O 
the O 
top O 
management O 
team. O 
This O 
downside O 
of O 
having O 
a O 
combined O 
CEO/chair O 
is O 
offset O 
by O 
(1) O 
a O 
reduction O 
of O 
coordination O 
and O 
communication O 
costs O 
at O 
the O 
top O 
of O 
the O 
organization O 
and O 
(2) O 
an O 
increase O 
in O 
the O 
negotiating O

the O 
CEO O 
when O 
dealing O 
with O 
suppliers, O 
potential O 
merger O

#2 O 
could O 
be O

the O 
top O 
management O 
team O

a O 
company O 
with O 
a O

It O

important O 
that O 
you O 
can O 
get O 
a O

the O 
trustworthiness O

there O 
a O

a O 
growth O 
industry O 
that O 
went O 
on O 
a O 
bender O 
and O 
is O 
now O 
trying O 
to O 
recover O 
from O 
the O 
hangover. O 
I've O 
always O 
felt O 
that O 
you O 
learn O 
a O 
lot O 
about O 
someone O 
when O 
you O 
see O 
how O 
they O 
try O 
to O 
recover O 
from O 
a O 
hangover O 
(pause O 
for O 
brief O 
college O 
flashback). O 
This O 
is O 
a O 
great O 
time O 
to O 
assess O 
organizational O 
effectiveness O 
in O 
the O 
telecommunications O 
equipment O 
industry. O 
Nortel ORG
and O 
Lucent ORG
attempted O 
to O 
hide O 
the O 
damage O 
(What O 
do O 
you O 
mean? O 
I'm O 
not O 
drunk!) O 
and O 
hope O 
for O 
an O 
uptick O 
in O 
demand O 
before O 
they O 
would O 
have O 
to O 
come O 
clean. O 
Both O 
companies O 
have O 
been O 
penalized O 
for O 
these O 
actions O 
and O 
have O 
continued O 
to O 
restructure O 
operations, O 
sell O 
assets, O 
and O 
layoff O 
employees. O 
Cisco, ORG
on O 
the O 
other O 
hand, O 
was O 
able O 
to O 
take O 
one O 
huge O 
restructuring O 
charge O 
in O 
2001 O 
and O 
move O 
forward. O 
Their O 
ability O 
to O 
do O 
this O 
and O 
have O 
it O 
work O 
(so O 
far) O 
indicates O 
a O 
very O 
deep O 
and O 
impressive O 
understanding O 
of O 
their O 
organization. O 
Especially O 
when O 
compared O 
to O 
its O 
competitors, O 
Cisco ORG
seems O 
to O 
be O 
back O 
in O 
fighting O 
form O 
due O 
to O 
it's O 
ability O 
to O 
rapidly O 
assess O 
its O 
organizational O 
structure O 
and O 
reconfigure O 
to O 
meet O 
the O 
changing O 
market. O 
Not O 
bad O 
for O 
a O 
company O 
with O 
a O 
hangover! O

Socially O

Corporate O 
social O 
responsibility. O 
Just O 
saying O 
these O 
words O 
seems O 
to O 
elicit O 
some O 
fairly O 
simplistic O 
knee-jerk O 
reactions. O 
The O 
reaction O 
that O 
I O 
find O 
most O 
amusing O 
is O 
the O 
knowing O 
look O 
of O 
sympathy. O 
You O 
know, O 
the O 
one O 
that O 
says O 
"Poor O 
naive O 
soul. O 
If O 
only O 
you O 
understood O 
economics, O 
you O 
would O 
understand O 
the O 
folly O 
of O 
your O 
ways." O 
I O 
do O 
not O 
intend O 
to O 
get O 
into O 
the O 
stakeholder O 
vs O 
stockholder O 
debate O 
here O 
or O 
argue O 
the O 
relative O 
merits O 
of O 
Atlas O 
Shrugged O 
. O 
Those O 
discussions, O 
though O 
interesting, O 
avoid O 
a O 
simpler O 
question. O 
Do O 
measures O 
of O 
corporate O 
social O 
responsibility O 
contain O 
valuable O 
added O 
information O 
that O 
help O 
investors O 
pick O 
winning O 
investments? O 
If O 
all O 
that O 
you O

, O 
you've O 
probably O 
heard O 
the O 
standard O 
answer-- O 
the O 
evidence O 
is O 
mixed. O 
That O 
is O 
true O 
but O 
not O 
very O 
revealing O 
wouldn't O 
you O 
say? O 
Evidence O 
is O 
mixed O 
mostly O 
because O 
(1) O 
there O 
is O 
little O 
agreement O 
about O 
how O 
to O 
measure O 
social O 
responsibility O 
and O 
(2) O 
many O 
current O 
measures O 
toss O 
together O 
a O 
heap O 
of O 
information O 
that O 
has O 
no O 
business O 
being O 
lumped O 
together. O 
Social O 
responsibility O 
often O 
includes O 
everything O 
from O 
treatment O 
of O 
employees O 
to O 
type O 
of O 
product O 
produced. O 
There O 
is O 
not O 
really O 
any O 
reason O 
to O 
believe O 
that O 
selling O 
guns O 
or O 
tobacco O 
has O 
anything O 
to O 
do O 
with O 
forcing O 
employees O 
to O 
work O 
unpaid O 
overtime. O 
Yet O 
both O 
get O 
lumped O 
together O 
in O 
the O 
socially O 
responsible O 
investing O 
discussion. O 
Once O 
you O 
start O 
to O 
break O 
apart O 
social O 
responsibility O 
into O 
its O 
various O 
components, O 
you O 
start O 
to O 
see O 
the O 
valuable O 
information. O 
Companies O 
that O 
have O 
poor O 
employee O 
relations O 
tend O 
to O 
underperform, O 
as O 
do O 
companies O 
that O 
pollute O 
at O 
a O 
higher O 
rate O 
than O 
their O 
industry O 
peers. O 
On O 
the O 
other O 
hand, O 
companies O 
with O 
numerous O 
NLRB ORG
violations O 
don't O 
do O 
worse O 
than O 
their O 
peers O 
and O 
companies O 
that O 
sell O 
your O 
typical O 
"sin" O 
products O 
(tobacco, O 
firearms, O 
gambling) O 
can O 
be O 
excellent O 
investments. O 
Lump O 
all O 
these O 
things O 
together O 
and O 
of O 
course O 
you O 
will O 
get O 
mixed O 
results. O 
Taken O 
separately, O 
they O 
provide O 
valuable O 
information O 
about O 
future O 
firm O 
performance. O 
I O

it O

Yesterday O 
was O 
a O 
tough O 
day O 
for O 
the O 
Seattle O 
scene. O 
Amazon ORG
ended O 
the O 
day O 
down O 
14.6%. O 
Starbucks ORG
down O 
8.2%. O 
I O 
should O 
disclose O 
that O 
I O 
spent O 
a O 
few O 
years O 
living O 
in O 
Seattle O 
and O 
I O 
have O 
a O 
soft O 
spot O 
in O 
my O 
heart O 
for O 
all O 
things O 
Seattle. O 
As O 
far O 
as O 
I O 
could O 
tell, O 
many O 
people O 
in O 
the O 
Northwest O 
spend O 
the O 
mornings O 
drinking O 
lattes O 
and O 
their O 
evenings O 
drinking O 
microbrews. O 
Really O 
not O 
a O 
bad O 
lifestyle. O 
Anyway, O 
back O 
on O 
topic O 
here. O 
Market O 
over O 
reaction? O 
Hard O 
to O 
say. O 
Both O 
companies O 
have O 
pricey O 
stocks O 
and O 
those O 
valuations O 
are O 
based O 
on O 
optimistic O 
expectations O 
of O 
future O 
growth. O 
Yesterday's O 
news O 
led O 
many O 
to O 
question O 
their O 
growth O 
assumptions O 
for O 
these O 
companies. O 
Today O 
I O 
want O 
to O 
talk O 
a O 
bit O 
about O 
Starbucks. ORG
I O 
think O 
I O 
have O 
to O 
start O 
by O 
acknowledging O 
that O 
the O 
stock O 
is O 
still O 
pricey O 
even O 
after O 
its O 
drop O 
yesterday. O 
However, O 
my O 
organizational O 
indicators O 
analysis O 
reveals O 
a O 
very O 
low O 
level O 
of O 
business O 
risk O 
. O 
This O 
may O 
partially O 
justify O 
a O 
higher O 
P/E O 
ratio. O 
A O 
couple O 
weeks O 
ago, O 
I O 
observed O 
that O 
Wal-Mart ORG
had O 
offsetting O 
strong O 
and O 
weak O 
organizational O 
indicators O 
. O 
Starbucks, ORG
on O 
the O 
other O 
hand, O 
has O 
uniformly O 
strong O 
organizational O 
indicators. O 
Starbucks ORG
scores O 
as O 
best O 
in O 
its O 
industry O 
on O 
six O 
of O 
seven O 
organizational O 
indicators. O 
Not O 
surprising O 
are O 
its O 
strong O 
scores O 
in O 
the O 
employee O 
relations O 
and O 
stakeholder O 
actions O 
indicators. O 
Its O 
weakest O 
score O 
is O 
in O 
the O 
external O 
reporting O 
indicator. O 
In O 
the O 
past, O 
several O 
observers O 
have O 
raised O 
concerns O 
about O 
aggressive O 
accounting O 
at O 
Starbucks ORG
but O 
my O 
analysis O 
does O 
not O 
indicate O 
any O 
systematic O 
current O 
issues. O 
The O 
weak O 
score O 
is O 
primarily O 
the O 
result O 
of O 
Starbucks ORG
current O 
strategy O 
of O 
increasing O 
equity O 
ownership O 
of O 
several O 
foreign O 
subsidiaries. O 
This O 
is O 
a O 
strategic O 
shift O 
that O 
has O 
short-term O 
costs O 
and O 
adds O 
some O 
uncertainty O 
to O 
the O 
financial O 
statements. O 
Beyond O 
the O 
strong O 
Organizational O 
Indicator O 
analysis, O 
several O 
additional O 
factors O 
favor O 
Starbucks ORG
ability O 
to O 
continue O 
to O 
grow O 
revenues. O 
1. O 
Starbucks ORG
has O 
little O 
debt. O 
Starbucks ORG
is O 
not O 
currently O 
financing O 
its O 
growth O 
with O 
debt. O 
Considering O 
its O 
growth, O 
this O 
is O 
amazing. O 
It O 
also O 
means O 
that O 
Starbucks ORG
has O 
a O 
large O 
amount O 
of O 
flexibility O 
in O 
how O 
it O 
finances O 
future O 
growth. O 
The O 
company O 
can O 
assume O 
much O 
more O 
debt O 
without O 
negatively O 
affecting O 
its O 
risk O 
profile O 
because... O 
2. O 
Starbucks ORG
has O 
a O 
healthy O 
cashflow O 
and O 
current O 
cash O 
position. O 
This O 
allows O 
the O 
company O 
to O 
grow O 
without O 
debt. O 
You O 
could O 
argue O 
that O 
Starbucks ORG
has O 
too O 
much O 
cash O 
and O 
should O 
do O 
more O 
to O 
pass O 
it O 
on O 
to O 
shareholders. O 
This O 
option O 
is O 
another O 
way O 
that O 
Starbucks ORG
has O 
retained O 
its O 
flexibility O 
for O 
the O 
future. O 
3. O 
Starbucks ORG
is O 
the O 
primary O 
owner O 
of O 
its O 
stores O 
and O 
limits O 
franchising. O 
While O 
Starbucks ORG
does O 
partner O 
(airlines, O 
airports, O 
Barnes ORG
&amp; ORG
Noble), ORG
most O 
of O 
its O 
stores O 
are O 
company O 
owned. O 
From O 
a O 
managerial O 
perspective O 
this O 
greatly O 
simplifies O 
cost O 
structures, O 
product O 
changes, O 
and O 
quality O 
control. O 
Taken O 
together O 
all O 
of O 
these O 
factors O 
paint O 
a O 
picture O 
of O 
a O 
company O 
with O 
a O 
very O 
strong O 
future. O 
I O 
cannot O 
say O 
if O 
these O 
factors O 
justify O 
the O 
current O 
share O 
price O 
but O 
I O 
would O 
say O 
that O 
they O 
justify O 
a O 
higher O 
P/E O 
ratio O 
than O 
the O 
industry O 
norm. O 
Risk O 
is O 
lower. O 
Interesting O 
aside: O 
Starbucks ORG
is O 
taking O 
over O 
the O 
location O 
in O 
my O 
town O 
that O 
was O
